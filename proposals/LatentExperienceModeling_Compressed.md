# Latent Experience Modeling for Counterfactual Reasoning in Agents

## Abstract

Autonomous agents excel at reactive behavior but lack counterfactual reasoning—the ability to simulate "what-if" scenarios crucial for higher-level cognition. This research develops a **latent experience model** that encodes an agent's multimodal experiences (perceptions, states, actions, outcomes) into a structured, continuous representation space. Rather than explicit symbolic logic, our approach uses learned latent representations to create computationally manipulable "vectorized episodic memory" supporting recall, imagination, and introspective reasoning.

The methodology centers on multimodal encoding with cross-attention fusion, temporal continuity modeling, and hierarchical abstraction via variational autoencoders. Testing occurs in a custom 2D gridworld over 40 weeks, producing a reusable neural architecture, evaluation toolkit, and interactive dashboard. Success demonstrates an agent capable of querying memory, interpolating experiences, and generating plausible alternative scenarios—bridging reactive learning and reflective reasoning with applications to adaptive decision-making and explainable AI.

## Research Objectives

Autonomous agents today excel at reactive behavior but lack the ability to reflect on past experiences or imagine alternative scenarios. Enabling **counterfactual reasoning** – the capacity to internally simulate "what-if" scenarios – is crucial for higher-level cognition and has been argued as essential for achieving general intelligence. The first milestone toward this capability is developing a **latent experience model**: a framework that encodes an agent's subjective experiences into a structured, continuous representation.

**Objective:** Construct a multimodal latent embedding space that preserves the structure and semantics of an agent's experiences, serving as memory and "imagination engine" for recall, interpolation, and counterfactual simulation. Rather than explicit symbolic logic, this approach leverages learned latent representations to make experience data computationally manipulable. In essence, we aim to build "vectorized episodic memory" that the agent can query, traverse, and transform—supporting memory recall, imagination, and introspective reasoning within the neural network itself.

This bridges purely reactive learning and reflective reasoning, enabling agents that not only learn from experience but can re-combine and transform experiences internally for novel situation reasoning. The expected result is an agent that can internally simulate alternative outcomes, improving adaptability to unforeseen situations.

**Significance:** Successfully modeling agent experiences in latent space would breakthrough introspective AI by providing a common substrate for memory and imagination. This supports advanced functions like internal simulation, narrative construction, and counterfactual planning while offering a path toward agents understanding their own experiences in human-like ways—identifying significant events or life phases as stepping stones toward explainability and safer AI behavior.

The project strikes a balance between ambitious innovation and feasible experimentation by building on established representation learning techniques (variational autoencoders, attention mechanisms) while targeting novel integration for introspective capabilities. All experiments will be conducted in a controlled custom 2D gridworld environment, providing rich multimodal sensory streams while remaining manageable for thorough evaluation within the grant period.

## Research Questions and Goals

This research addresses core questions about encoding and utilizing agent experiences:

- **What latent space structure best preserves meaning and temporal sequence of experiences?**
- **How can diverse modalities—visual, proprioceptive, reward signals—integrate into unified experience embeddings?**
- **Can learned latent space support both accurate reconstruction and imaginative transformation of experiences?**
- **What markers indicate well-structured latent space for agent cognition and introspection?**

Success would demonstrate an agent's internal latent memory that can be traversed smoothly, queried semantically, and altered to produce believable hypothetical scenarios—showing machine introspection through reflection on and imagination of experience variations.

## Proposed Methodology

Our multi-layer neural architecture has four key components: multimodal encoding, temporal continuity, hierarchical abstraction, and rigorous evaluation.

### 1. Multimodal Experience Encoding

Each timestep encodes into a compact vector capturing what the agent sensed, did, and felt. Multiple encoders process different modalities (visual observations, proprioceptive state, actions, rewards) then merge outputs into joint latent vectors using variational autoencoder framework for latent space sampling.

**Cross-Attention Fusion:** Rather than simple concatenation, cross-attention mechanisms allow features from one modality to attend to others, enabling contextual fusion where reward signals attend to visual features indicating goal states. We explore both full cross-attention and bottlenecked approaches to compare efficiency and interpretability.

**Reward-Affect Encoding:** A dedicated reward-affect encoder with contrastive valence loss injects affective structure, ensuring experiences carry outcome information critical for reasoning about "dangerous" vs "safe" states. This transforms reward history into "affective context" embeddings that separate positive and negative valence experiences.

The autoencoder's decoder reconstructs multimodal experiences from latent vectors, with training on full experience tuples ensuring no modality is ignored. Modality dropout during training prevents single channel dominance, while VAE regularization enables smooth interpolation between experiences.

### 2. Temporal Continuity and Sequence Modeling

Experiences unfold temporally, requiring latent space respect for temporal structure. Sequential encoders (Transformers with positional embeddings, LSTMs/GRUs) process episode windows to produce higher-level embeddings, ensuring temporal transition information reflects in representations.

**Trajectory Segmentation:** Long experiences break into segments using attention pooling and surprise-based event detection, creating hierarchy (timestep → segment → episode) that prevents distant episode parts from interfering. This mirrors how humans recall long experiences in chunks.

**Latent Trajectory Alignment:** We visualize entire latent trajectories by projecting episode latent vectors over time into 2D using t-SNE or UMAP to see the "shape" of experiences in latent space. Dynamic Time Warping alignment will compare latent trajectories to see if similar sub-sequences map to similar latent paths, revealing narrative arcs or distinct phases.

**Smooth Interpolation:** Temporal continuity enforcement through smoothness regularization (‖z_{t+1}-z_t‖²) enables latent traversability—interpolating between latent points generates plausible intermediate experiences crucial for counterfactual reasoning. Smoothly navigable latent space allows agents to "slide" along dimensions of variation and see what could have happened.

### 3. Hierarchical Abstraction

To support both low-level detail and high-level reasoning, the latent model uses hierarchical representation learning at multiple abstraction levels.

**Hierarchical VAE:** We implement a three-tier HVAE with lower layer (z₁) capturing fine details, middle layer (z₂) encoding episodic segments, and higher layer (z₃) capturing abstract features like overall situation context. This ladder of abstraction ensures top-level variables summarize broader state ("in danger," "searching for goal") without pixel-level clutter.

**Attention-Based Abstraction:** We use attention pooling where transformers attend over sequences of low-level embeddings to form summary vectors. This dynamic pooling focuses on key "event" moments (reward spikes, collisions) when forming episode summaries, with attention heatmaps exposed for interpretation.

**Self-Supervised Tasks:** Auxiliary objectives (phase prediction, reward forecasting) inject semantic structure, encouraging higher layers to encode concepts like goal proximity or trajectory quality. A layer that can predict long-term reward likely encodes being on good vs. bad trajectories.

The hierarchical design provides multiple memory resolutions: precise details (low-level latents) or broad strokes (high-level latents), analogous to recalling event gist versus exact action sequences.

### 4. Evaluation and Validation

Developing this latent experience space requires rigorous evaluation of whether the space is actually useful and meaningful for agent cognition. We employ multiple evaluation methods and metrics:

**Reconstruction Fidelity:** We measure how well the autoencoder reconstructs experiences using pixel-level reconstruction error (SSIM), state reconstruction error (MSE), and action/reward prediction accuracy. High reconstruction accuracy ensures the latent representation retains critical information.

**Semantic Clustering:** We assess if similar experiences cluster together in latent space using unsupervised clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and evaluate cluster quality with silhouette score, cluster purity, and normalized mutual information against ground-truth labels. The latent space should naturally separate different behavioral modes.

**Temporal Coherence:** We measure multi-step rollout error and divergence horizon to assess temporal consistency, including curvature and smoothness metrics to quantify latent trajectory stability over time.

**Hierarchical Validation:** Layer-wise reconstruction tests and cross-layer experiments confirm abstraction levels are properly separated, with each tier evaluated for appropriate detail reconstruction and semantic coherence.

**Latent Traversal:** We perform interpolation experiments between points in latent space, examining decoded sequences for plausible gradual transitions. Smooth transitions indicate small latent moves correspond to semantically small experience changes.

**Perturbation Testing:** We test semantic consistency by slightly modifying inputs and checking if latent representations change appropriately. Well-structured models should exhibit local linearity: small latent changes = small, sensible experience changes.

**Counterfactual Generation:** We take failed episodes and use gradient-based tweaks to modify episode latent representations toward desired outcomes, then decode modified sequences. Successful counterfactual edits should represent plausible alternative outcomes, scored by rule-based plausibility checks and human ratings.

## Implementation Plan

This project will be executed by a single researcher, which informed the choice of scope and tools to ensure feasibility. All development and testing will use a custom 2D gridworld environment as the testbed.

**Environment:** Custom 2D gridworld providing rich multimodal data while enabling rapid iteration and extensive training data generation. The environment will be instrumented to log full experience traces including visual observations, abstract state variables, and rewards.

**Data Collection:** We generate a dataset of agent trajectories using exploration policies to gather diverse experiences, storing each trajectory as a sequence of multi-modal observations with event labels.

**Architecture:** PyTorch-based implementation with modular components for multimodal fusion, sequence modeling, and hierarchical encoding. Training proceeds in two phases: (1) unsupervised autoencoder training on trajectories, (2) fine-tuning with auxiliary tasks for semantic structure.

**Training:** We use reconstruction losses (MSE, cross-entropy, perceptual loss) and regularization terms (KL divergence, contrastive losses). Training is iterative: after individual step encoding is learned, we incorporate sequence/episode encoders.

## Expected Deliverables

By the end of the project, we expect to produce several tangible outputs with significant value to the research community:

**Multimodal Latent Embedding Model:** A fully implemented neural architecture (in code library form) that can encode an agent's experience logs into latent vectors and decode them back to reconstructions. This will be a reusable system applicable to other environments or robots with minimal adjustment (just requiring retraining on their data). The code will be documented and open-sourced for the research community interested in agent memory and representation learning. The model exposes a common API—encode(), query(), counterfactual()—for downstream planners and interactive analysis.

**Evaluation Toolkit:** A comprehensive suite of analysis tools for latent spaces, including scripts to visualize latent trajectories (using UMAP/t-SNE plots), cluster latent points and compute metrics (silhouette scores, normalized mutual information), and perform latent interpolations and reconstructions. This toolkit helps evaluate not only our model but could be useful for others building representation learning systems—essentially a set of diagnostics for "how good is my learned latent representation?" The toolkit includes automated evaluation pipelines for reconstruction fidelity, semantic clustering, temporal coherence, and counterfactual generation quality.

**Interactive Dashboard:** A real-time exploration interface for latent trajectories, semantic relationships, and counterfactual generation. The dashboard includes latent traversal sliders, UMAP/t-SNE explorers with interactive filtering, rollout vs. ground-truth comparisons, attention heatmap visualizations, and automated failure-case logging. Users can drill down through hierarchical latent layers, explore cross-modal attention patterns, and generate counterfactual scenarios through intuitive interfaces.

**Annotated Dataset:** We will compile a dataset of agent trajectories in the gridworld along with their latent encodings and relevant labels (important events, outcomes, behavioral phases). This dataset with latent vectors will be valuable for anyone studying how to extract high-level events from raw agent experience or for comparing different embedding approaches on common ground. We will also label certain "experience events" (reaching goals, encountering obstacles, strategy shifts) to facilitate supervised evaluation of latent clustering and enable reproducible benchmarking.

**Agent Meta-Embedding System:** A meta-embedding framework over episodes that serves as a self-signature for personalization and policy selection, enabling agents to recognize their own behavioral patterns and adapt strategies accordingly. This system allows agents to query their experience history semantically ("find episodes where I achieved high reward in dangerous situations") and use these retrievals for few-shot learning in new scenarios.

**Research Documentation:** A detailed technical report containing methodology, results, and analysis, structured like an academic paper. This report will include:
- Comprehensive visualizations of latent space organization with 2D plots of latent points color-coded by scenario, showing meaningful experience organization
- Temporal plots of single episodes' latent paths illustrating how agent journeys are represented internally
- Phase transition examples highlighting cases where agent behavior mode changes (exploring vs. exploiting) and their appearance in latent space
- Counterfactual scenario demonstrations with before-and-after trajectory pairs showing successful "imagination" of alternative outcomes
- Quantitative metrics tables summarizing reconstruction errors, clustering quality, and downstream task performance
- Discussion of latent structure interpretability, including analysis of what dimensions or regions encode (energy levels, temporal progression, danger assessment)

The report will serve as both validation of our approach and documentation for others interested in latent episodic modeling, with portions suitable for submission to relevant AI and cognitive robotics conferences.

## Anticipated Impact

If successful, this project will contribute significantly to the field of AI in several key ways:

**Framework for Introspective Agents:** We introduce a novel framework that allows agents to store and reason about their own experiences in a learned latent space. This goes beyond traditional reinforcement learning by giving agents queryable and manipulable memory, enabling capabilities like explanation and strategy analysis through internal simulation. The framework provides a common substrate for memory and imagination, supporting counterfactual reasoning as a component of general intelligence.

**Multimodal Representation Learning Advances:** The project demonstrates new methods to align and fuse multiple sensor modalities into single representations without losing unique information. The cross-attention fusion approach could apply to broader multimodal learning problems, while our reward-conditioned encoding provides a blueprint for embedding complex streams into VAEs with temporal and semantic structure.

**Hierarchical Memory Structures:** We contribute insights into building hierarchical memories combining time-scale and representational abstraction. This could influence continual learning research by offering ways to compress long histories without forgetting important events. The concept of episodes within episodes could improve memory efficiency in long-horizon tasks by drastically reducing sequence length through chunking approaches.

**Evaluation Standards for Latent Spaces:** By focusing on evaluating latent experience space quality, we help formalize what makes embeddings "good" for cognitive tasks, encouraging broader adoption of semantic and temporal fidelity measures as standard practice in representation learning research.

**Practical Tool for Agent Design:** The latent experience model can serve as a module in complex cognitive architectures, enabling imagination-guided planning where agents generate realistic hypothetical scenarios on demand for internal lookahead simulations more abstract and flexible than classical model-based planning.

In summary, the project's contributions are both foundational (new approaches to structure agent memories) and empirical (demonstrating effectiveness with clear benefits). By the end, we expect a working demonstration of an agent with latent introspection—a notable milestone in moving AI systems toward ones that can think about their own experiences.

## Risk Mitigation

While the plan is ambitious, we have identified key challenges and developed strategies to address each:

**Multimodal Integration Complexity:** Fusing diverse data streams (images, states, rewards) into one latent representation is non-trivial. Each modality has different scale and noise characteristics, with risk that one modality might dominate latent encoding or that the model fails to align them properly.

*Mitigation:* We use modality-specific encoders and cross-attention with modality dropout during training. If fusion underperforms, a fallback is training separate embeddings then merging. Our evaluation metrics will quickly show if any modality is being ignored.

**Reconstruction vs. Imagination Trade-off:** A model that perfectly reconstructs might overfit, while one flexible in generating scenarios might not remember details faithfully.

*Mitigation:* We tune the VAE's β-value to balance fidelity and abstraction, potentially using a β schedule. Our hierarchical latents inherently provide a solution: higher latents enable imagination while lower latents ensure reconstruction fidelity.

**Semantic Consistency Challenges:** Quantifying "semantically meaningful" changes in latent space can be tricky, with risk of nonsense feature combinations.

*Mitigation:* Our inclusion of reward and temporal structure helps latent dimensions align naturally. Auxiliary tasks act as anchors, training the model to align latent features with known semantic targets. We perform qualitative checks on decoded reconstructions from interpolated latents.

**Generalization Concerns:** Since experiments are in gridworld, the model might not generalize to other environments or overfit to gridworld quirks.

*Mitigation:* We intentionally vary gridworld scenarios during training to encourage encoding of general aspects rather than memorizing specific mazes. We'll test on held-out configurations to demonstrate generalization.

**Interpretability Challenges:** High-dimensional latent spaces can be hard to interpret.

*Mitigation:* Our evaluation includes correlation analysis between latent dimensions and known factors. The hierarchical aspect helps interpretability, with top-layer features being more abstract and easier to map to concepts.

The challenges above are real, but each is met with a plan in our approach. By breaking the problem down (modality fusion, temporal encoding, hierarchy), we isolate where issues might occur and address them with known techniques or careful experimental design. The risk is balanced by use of proven components (VAEs, Transformers, attention) and flexibility of a simulation environment we control. Even partial success would yield valuable insights to report, and the potential payoff of agents that can introspect and reason about "what could have been" makes these challenges worth tackling.
