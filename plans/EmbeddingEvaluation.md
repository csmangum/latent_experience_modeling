# **Embedding Evaluation Framework**

## **1. Reconstruction Fidelity**

### Goals:

- Verify the embedding accurately captures original multimodal experiences.

### Methods:

- **Modality-specific reconstruction accuracy**:
    - Visual: Pixel-wise MSE, SSIM
    - Proprioceptive/Internal State: MSE, MAE, categorical accuracy
    - Actions: Classification accuracy (discrete), RMSE (continuous)
    - Reward signals: Prediction accuracy, RMSE
- 🔁 **Information retention analysis**: Decompose ELBO to track reconstruction vs. regularization tradeoffs.

### Experiments:

- Reconstruction of complete sequences vs. single timesteps.
- Evaluate impact of hierarchical structure on fidelity.
- 🔁 Include **mutual information estimation** between inputs and latents (e.g., MINE, InfoNCE proxy).

### Deliverables:

- Baseline reconstruction metrics and SSIM visual comparisons.
- Latent–reconstruction heatmap visualizations.
