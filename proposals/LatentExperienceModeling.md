# Latent Experience Modeling for Counterfactual Reasoning in Agents

## Research Objectives

Autonomous agents today excel at reactive behavior but lack the ability to reflect on past experiences or imagine alternative scenarios. Enabling **counterfactual reasoning** – the capacity to internally simulate “what-if” scenarios – is seen as a crucial step toward higher-level cognition and has even been argued as *essential for achieving general intelligence*. The first milestone toward this capability is to develop a **latent experience model**: a framework that encodes an agent’s subjective experiences (perceptions, internal states, actions, outcomes) into a structured, continuous representation. Rather than using explicit symbolic logic, this approach leverages learned latent representations to make the agent’s own experience data *computationally manipulable*. In essence, we aim to build a kind of *vectorized episodic memory* that the agent can query, traverse, and transform – supporting memory recall, imagination, and introspective reasoning within the agent’s neural network itself.

**Objective:** Construct a multimodal latent embedding space that preserves the structure and semantics of an agent’s experiences. This latent space will serve as the agent’s memory and “imagination engine,” enabling it to recall past events, interpolate between experiences, and simulate counterfactual scenarios. By doing so, we bridge the gap between purely reactive learning and reflective reasoning. The expected result is an agent that not only learns from experience, but can *re-combine and transform* experiences internally to reason about novel situations. This capability lays groundwork for more resilient and adaptable AI – recent work suggests that giving agents the ability to internally simulate alternative outcomes can improve their adaptability to unforeseen situations.

**Significance:** Successfully modeling an agent’s experiences in a latent space would be a breakthrough for introspective AI. It provides a *common substrate* for memory and imagination, supporting advanced functions like internal simulation, narrative construction of an agent’s life, and counterfactual planning. Moreover, such a model offers a path toward agents that understand their own experiences in a human-like way (e.g. identifying “significant events” or phases in their history), which is a stepping stone toward explainability and safer AI behavior. This project strikes a **balance between ambitious innovation and feasible experimentation** – it builds on established representation learning techniques (like variational autoencoders and attention mechanisms) while targeting a novel integration of these components to achieve introspective capabilities. All experiments will be conducted in a controlled **custom 2D gridworld environment**, which provides rich multimodal sensory streams (e.g. visual grid observations, agent position/proprioception, reward signals) but is simple enough to allow rapid iteration. By focusing on a simulated gridworld, we ensure the project remains manageable for a single researcher and that the approach can be thoroughly evaluated within the grant period.

## **Research Questions and Goals**

This research will be guided by several core questions aimed at determining how to best encode and utilize an agent’s experiences in latent form:

- **What structure of latent space best preserves the meaning and temporal sequence of an experience?** (How do we encode episodic memory so that important events and the order in which they occur are retained?)
- **How can diverse modalities – visual input, proprioceptive data, internal state signals, rewards – be integrated into a unified experience embedding?** (What architectural choices allow us to fuse different data types into one coherent representation?)
- **Can the learned latent space support both accurate reconstruction of past experiences *and* imaginative transformation of those experiences?** (Does our model allow an agent to not only remember accurately, but also generate plausible new variations of its experiences?)
- **What are the markers of a well-structured latent space in the context of agent cognition and introspection?** (For example, do similar behaviors cluster together? Can we identify latent dimensions that correspond to meaningful factors like “danger vs safety” or “task phase”?)

By answering these questions, we aim to validate that our latent experience model truly captures the *essence* of the agent’s life history in a form that is useful for higher-level reasoning. A successful outcome would show that the agent’s internal latent memory can be traversed smoothly (interpolating between experiences yields continuous, meaningful transitions), queried for semantic content (“find an episode where I achieved high reward”), and even altered to produce novel yet believable hypothetical scenarios. These capabilities would demonstrate a form of **machine introspection** – the agent reflecting on and imagining variations of its own past.

## **Proposed Methodology**

To create this latent experience model, we will design a **multi-layer neural architecture** trained on the agent’s experience data. The approach can be summarized in four key components: (1) multimodal encoding of experiences at each time step, (2) preservation of temporal continuity across sequences of experience, (3) hierarchical abstraction for multi-scale memory representations, and (4) rigorous evaluation of the learned latent space. The following sections detail each component of the methodology.

### **1. Multimodal Experience Encoding**

Each time step of the agent’s life will be encoded into a compact vector that captures **what the agent sensed, did, and felt** at that moment. This involves fusing data from multiple modalities into one representation: for instance, an observation might include a camera image (or gridworld view), the agent’s proprioceptive state (position, velocity, etc.), its last action taken, and any reward or internal reinforcement signal received. We propose to implement this with an **autoencoder-based architecture** where *multiple encoders* process different modalities and then merge their outputs into a joint latent vector. A variational autoencoder (VAE) framework will likely be used so that we can sample from the latent space to imagine new experiences.

- **Joint Latent Space Alignment:** Simply concatenating modalities is unlikely to capture their relationships. Instead, we will explore **cross-attention mechanisms** to allow features from one modality to attend to features of another. Cross-attention has been shown to be a powerful way for models to combine information from different modalities by *dynamically weighting* one modality’s features based on the content of another. For example, the model could attend to visual features relevant to the current proprioceptive state or reward signal, ensuring the fused representation reflects the context (e.g. a high reward signal might attend to features in the visual input that indicate a goal state). This contextual fusion is preferable to treating all inputs as an unstructured concatenation.
- **Reward and Affect Encoding:** A unique aspect of our encoder will be a component that specifically handles *reward signals or other affective tags*. The agent’s positive or negative outcomes (e.g., gaining a reward or experiencing a penalty) will be encoded in such a way that the latent vector carries information about the *valence* of the experience. This could be as simple as concatenating a reward scalar into the latent vector, or as complex as an auxiliary network that transforms reward history into an “affective context” embedding. The intuition is that experiences are colored by their outcomes – knowing an episode was a failure or success is critical for reasoning about it later. By explicitly encoding reward context, the latent space can represent notions like “dangerous state” or “safe state” as directions or regions in the space.

The **autoencoder’s decoder** will learn to reconstruct the multimodal experience from the latent vector, ensuring that the encoding captures all necessary details. Training the encoder/decoder on reconstruction of full experience tuples (image, state, action, outcome) ensures that no modality is ignored in the latent coding. VAEs in particular impose a regularized latent structure (via a KL-divergence loss) which can prevent overfitting and facilitate smooth interpolation between experiences. *Notably, variational autoencoders have a strong track record in reinforcement learning for representation learning – they have been used to compress high-dimensional observations in model-based RL.* This gives us confidence that a VAE-based approach can handle rich inputs like images or sensor arrays. However, prior work often focused on encoding single observations or short sequences; our innovation is to extend this to **entire experiences with multiple modalities** and to structure the latent space for long-horizon use.

### **2. Temporal Continuity and Sequence Modeling**

Experiences unfold over time, and a key requirement is that our latent space respects the *temporal structure* of episodes. Two consecutive moments in time should map to nearby points in latent space (assuming the experience doesn’t dramatically change), and the trajectory of an entire episode through the latent space should itself be meaningful. We will achieve this by incorporating **sequence modeling** into the architecture:

- **Sequential Encoder:** In addition to encoding each timestep, we will use a sequence model (such as a Transformer encoder or a recurrent network like an LSTM/GRU) that processes a *window or episode* of these per-step latent vectors. This network will produce a higher-level embedding for the entire sequence (for example, outputting an “episode vector” after processing 100 time steps). By training this sequential encoder jointly with the step-wise encoders, we ensure that information about how states transition and how events are ordered is reflected in the latent representation. Essentially, the model learns an embedding for “stories” (sequences of events) not just isolated snapshots. We will experiment with techniques like **temporal convolution** and **transformer positional encodings** to give the model a sense of chronological order. If using Transformers, positional embeddings or learned time-index embeddings will be included so that the model knows the sequence order.
- **Trajectory Segmentation:** We plan to create **chunked representations** for long experiences. Rather than encoding an entire lengthy episode into one vector, it may be beneficial to break an agent’s life into segments or *scenes* (e.g. “episode phases”). Each segment can be encoded, and then a higher-level encoder can compress the sequence of segment embeddings. This hierarchy (timestep -> segment -> full episode) prevents information from distant parts of a long episode from interfering with each other, and it mirrors how humans recall long experiences in chunks or scenes. We will investigate methods to automatically segment trajectories (e.g. based on changes in dynamics or reward) and encode each segment.
- **Latent Trajectory Alignment:** A fascinating analytic we will perform is to visualize entire **latent trajectories** of episodes. By projecting an episode’s latent vectors (over time) into 2D (with t-SNE or UMAP), we can see the “shape” of an experience in latent space. We will develop techniques to align and compare these latent trajectories – for instance, two different runs of the agent in the gridworld can be compared to see if similar sub-sequences map to similar latent paths. If our model is successful, we expect that latent trajectories will reveal *narrative arcs* or distinct phases (e.g., wandering, then finding a key, then heading to a goal might form a recognizable pattern in latent space). Aligning trajectories could allow detection of *behavioral shifts* (change points where the agent switches strategy), which is useful for introspection (the agent could later identify “this is the point where things went wrong”).
- **Smooth Interpolation:** By enforcing temporal continuity, we also aim for **latent traversability** – the ability to interpolate between points in latent space and generate a plausible intermediate experience. For example, if we take two latent vectors from different time points or different scenarios, moving along the line between them in latent space should ideally correspond to a meaningful morphing of one experience into the other. We will test this by picking points in latent space and decoding them to see if the decoded experiences look coherent. A smoothly navigable latent space is crucial for counterfactual reasoning: the agent can “slide” along dimensions of variation (like slightly altering a past action or outcome) and see what could have happened.

### **3. Hierarchical and Abstract Representations**

To support both low-level detail and high-level reasoning, the latent model will be **hierarchical**. This means we will learn representations at multiple levels of abstraction:

- **Hierarchical VAE (HVAE):** We will design the autoencoder with multiple stochastic layers – for instance, a lower latent layer z1z_1 that captures fine details (e.g. immediate sensor readings and motor outputs) and a higher latent layer z2z_2 that captures more abstract features (e.g. the overall situation or context of the moment). During encoding, z1z_1 might first be inferred from data, and then z2z_2 is inferred from z1z_1. The decoder similarly uses z2z_2 to generate coarse features and z1z_1 to generate specifics. This **ladder of abstraction** ensures that the top-level latent variables aren’t cluttered with micromanaging pixel-level details, but instead summarize broader state (like “in danger” or “searching for goal”). Hierarchical VAEs have been shown to better separate factors of variation and can reflect conceptual abstraction (they have even been used to model brain responses with multiple layers corresponding to different levels of stimulus features).
- **Attention-Based Abstraction:** We will also explore using **attention pooling** to create high-level representations. For example, a transformer could attend over an entire sequence of low-level embeddings and pick out salient parts to form a summary vector. This dynamic pooling means the model could learn to focus on key “event” moments (such as a spike in reward or a collision) when forming an episode summary. The result is that higher-level latent vectors might correspond to meaningful events or segments (similar to how a person’s summary of a day might highlight a few notable moments). Recent work on hierarchical memory for robots suggests that representing experiences in a pyramid of detail vs. summary is effective – for instance, Bärmann et al. (2024) construct a tree of episodic memory where **lower levels are raw perceptions and higher levels encode abstracted events**. Inspired by this, our model’s top layer will aim to capture an “overview” of an episode (or long segment) in terms of abstract properties (like the outcome, the main goal achieved, etc.), whereas lower layers handle step-by-step sensations.
- **Self-Supervised Semantic Tasks:** To guide the formation of useful abstractions, we will incorporate **auxiliary learning tasks**. These are additional objectives the network tries to predict from the latent representation, which inject semantic structure. Examples include *phase prediction* (having the model predict if a given time step is in the “beginning, middle, or end” of an episode, or which scenario the agent is in) and *reward forecasting* (predict the cumulative reward ahead). By training the latent features to perform these tasks, we encourage the higher-level layers to encode concepts like “how close am I to achieving the goal” or “what general situation am I in right now.” For instance, a higher layer that can predict long-term reward likely has learned to encode the notion of being on a good vs. bad trajectory. These abstract encodings can then be leveraged when the agent imagines counterfactuals (e.g. “what if I were in a high-reward situation instead?”).

Overall, the hierarchical design means the agent’s memory will have **multiple resolutions**: it can recall precise details when needed (from low-level latents) or think in broad strokes (with high-level latents). This is analogous to a person recalling the gist of a past event versus the exact sequence of actions – both levels are useful for different kinds of reasoning.

### **4. Embedding Evaluation and Validation**

Developing this latent experience space is not just about training the model – we need to rigorously evaluate whether the space is *actually useful and meaningful* for the agent’s cognition. We will use a variety of evaluation methods and metrics:

- **Reconstruction Fidelity:** First, as a sanity check, we’ll measure how well the autoencoder reconstructs experiences. This includes pixel-level reconstruction error for visual observations, error in reconstructing states and sensor readings, and accuracy in predicting the agent’s actions or rewards when decoding. High reconstruction accuracy (e.g., high structural similarity index for images) ensures the latent representation hasn’t discarded critical information. This is necessary but not sufficient – we also need the latent code to be **structured** in a semantically meaningful way, not just a black-box compression.
- **Clustering and Semantic Cohesion:** We will assess if similar experiences cluster together in latent space. For example, do all the latent vectors corresponding to the agent picking up a key form a cluster distinct from those where the agent is wandering empty space? We will apply unsupervised clustering (like K-means or DBSCAN) on the latent vectors and evaluate cluster quality using metrics such as silhouette score or normalized mutual information (NMI) against ground-truth labels of situations (if available). Ideally, the latent space will *naturally separate* different behavioral modes or contexts. Prior work in offline RL has noted that a simple VAE embedding of trajectories often fails to retain *policy-level semantics*, leading to clusters that mix different behaviors. Our approach, with temporal and reward structure, is intended to overcome that by explicitly encoding those semantics. We will verify this by checking if clusters correspond to real strategy differences or outcome differences.
- **Latent Traversal Tests:** To test **latent traversability**, we will perform interpolation experiments. Taking two points in latent space (for instance, the start and end of an episode, or two different episodes), we will interpolate between them and decode the intermediate latent vectors. We’ll then examine the decoded sequences to see if they represent a plausible gradual transition. If the latent space is smooth, an interpolation should look like a valid fictitious experience blending the characteristics of both endpoints. We will have human evaluators or automated checks verify the coherence of these interpolated experiences (e.g., does an agent’s position move logically, do images change gradually, etc.). Smooth transitions indicate that small moves in latent space correspond to logical, *semantically small* changes in the experience – an important sign that the space is well-structured.
- **Perturbation and Robustness:** Another evaluation is **semantic consistency under perturbation**. We will slightly perturb an input (like modify one sensor reading or one video frame) and see if the latent representation changes only slightly and in a relevant way. Conversely, we can perturb the latent vector in a small way and decode it to see if the resulting experience is only a minor variation of the original. If tiny latent tweaks cause large nonsense changes in the decoded output, the space might not be encoding things in a semantically organized manner. We expect a well-structured latent model to exhibit *local linearity*: small latent changes = small, sensible experience changes. This can be quantified by measuring changes in decoded outputs or through latent space Jacobian analysis.
- **Visualization:** We will produce visualizations to gain qualitative insight. Using tools like **t-SNE or UMAP**, we’ll project high-dimensional latent vectors down to 2D for thousands of time-steps or for entire episodes. We will color-code these points by known context (like color by reward magnitude, or by whether the agent was carrying an item) to visually inspect if those factors are spatially separated in the plot. For example, we might see a UMAP plot where all high-reward states cluster in one region – that would confirm the model understands something akin to “goal achieved” vs “ongoing search.” We will also plot latent trajectories over these maps, drawing lines connecting the sequence of an episode in the 2D projection, to observe patterns like loops or distinct phases. These visualizations will be included in the project report to illustrate how experiences are laid out in the agent’s “mind space.”

Finally, a critical test of our latent model is its **downstream utility**: we will integrate it into a simple planning or imagination task to see if it indeed enables new capabilities. For example, we can take the learned latent model and use it for a **counterfactual reasoning demo**: fix an episode where the agent failed a task, then use gradient-based tweaks or latent vector arithmetic to modify the episode’s latent representation towards a desired outcome (e.g., “what if I had turned left instead of right at that junction?”) and decode this modified latent sequence. If the agent’s model is good, the decoded sequence should represent a plausible alternative outcome (maybe the agent avoids the obstacle and succeeds). We can then feed that imagined successful trajectory back to the agent’s policy to see if it improves future performance or understanding. The ability to generate such counterfactual trajectories would be a strong validation that the latent experience model is doing its intended job. It also provides a demonstration of **introspection** – the agent effectively “daydreaming” about what could have happened and learning from it.

## **Project Plan and Implementation Details**

This project will be executed by a single researcher (the applicant), which informed the choice of scope and tools to ensure feasibility. All development and testing will use a **custom 2D gridworld environment** as the testbed. This environment is ideal for our needs: it can provide rich multimodal data (top-down visual observations, structured state information, etc.) while being easily customizable to create various scenarios (maze navigation, item collection, danger zones, etc.). Moreover, gridworld simulations are lightweight, allowing fast iteration and extensive training data generation without requiring a large compute cluster. The environment will be instrumented to log the full **experience traces** of the agent, including everything from raw pixels (if used) to abstract state variables and rewards at each step.

**Data Collection:** We will generate a dataset of agent trajectories in the gridworld. Initially, the agent’s policy can be a simple exploration or semi-random policy to gather a wide variety of experiences (ensuring the latent model is exposed to diverse situations). As the project progresses, we might incorporate a learning agent (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) whose policy improves, to collect trajectories with interesting behavior (successes and failures, strategy shifts, etc.). However, even without sophisticated policies, one can script the agent to perform certain patterns (go to goal, wander, etc.) to get labeled varieties of experiences for evaluation purposes. Each trajectory will be stored as a sequence of multi-modal observations. We will also create “event labels” for key occurrences (for instance, if the agent picks up a key or reaches the goal) to use in evaluating latent clustering.

**Model Training:** The neural network architecture (encoders, decoder, sequence model, etc.) will be implemented in PyTorch (or a similar framework). Training will proceed in two phases: (1) unsupervised (or self-supervised) training of the autoencoder components on the collected trajectories, and (2) fine-tuning or auxiliary task training to imbue semantic structure (predicting rewards, segmenting phases, etc., as described earlier). We will use a combination of reconstruction loss terms (mean squared error for states, cross-entropy for categorical data like actions, possibly perceptual loss for images) and regularization terms (KL divergence for VAE, contrastive losses to push apart dissimilar experiences and pull together similar ones, etc.). Training will be iterative: after initial encoding of individual steps is learned, we incorporate the sequence/episode encoder so that it learns to compress whole episodes. We anticipate training on the order of tens of thousands of episodes, which is easily attainable in a gridworld. Because the model is unsupervised and relatively large (with potentially millions of parameters), we will make heavy use of modern hardware (GPUs) available to the researcher. However, the computational load is reasonable given the input size (gridworld images are small, e.g., 2D grids of maybe 10x10 or 20x20 cells, and state vectors are small).

During development, we will routinely evaluate the latent space as described, adjusting the model as needed. For example, if we find that one modality’s information (say, reward signals) isn’t well-represented in latent vectors (perhaps the model is focusing mostly on images), we can upweight that modality’s loss or add an auxiliary loss (like predicting the reward from the latent) to force better encoding. We’ll also try ablation experiments: e.g., train variants of the model without cross-attention or without hierarchical layers to see how much those contribute to performance. This will help demonstrate which design choices are most important for structuring the latent space.

**Timeline:** The project is structured into stages aligning with the above components:

1. *Month 1-2:* Environment setup and data collection (random policy and basic scripted behaviors to gather initial trajectory data). Implementation of the base VAE autoencoder for single-step encoding.
2. *Month 3-4:* Integrate sequence model for temporal encoding; train the combined model on multi-step sequences. Begin qualitative evaluations of reconstructions and latent interpolations.
3. *Month 5:* Introduce hierarchical layers and auxiliary tasks; refine the model to improve abstraction and semantic encoding. Collect additional trajectories if needed (for example, focus on edge cases or more complex behaviors).
4. *Month 6:* Extensive evaluation of the latent space structure (clustering, traversals, etc.). Conduct the counterfactual imagination experiments to demonstrate the model’s utility.
5. *Month 7:* Prepare deliverables – finalize the toolkit for embedding and evaluation, compile results into diagrams and figures, and document everything.
6. *Month 8:* Write the research report and proposal deliverables, highlighting results and case studies (some buffer time is included to handle unexpected hurdles or to run additional experiments that might come up from reviewer feedback).

This timeline is achievable by a single researcher and provides a **good balance** between exploration of novel ideas and concrete milestones. By focusing on a simplified domain (gridworld) and incremental building of the model, we mitigate risks – if one approach fails, we can iterate quickly. At the same time, each component of the project (multimodal fusion, hierarchical memory, introspective queries) pushes the envelope on agent cognition, ensuring the work remains innovative.

## **Expected Deliverables**

By the end of the project, we expect to produce several tangible outputs:

- **Multimodal Latent Embedding Model:** A fully implemented neural architecture (likely in code library form) that can encode an agent’s experience logs into latent vectors and decode them back to reconstructions. This will be a reusable system, meaning it could be applied to other environments or robots with minimal adjustment (just needing retraining on their data). The code will be documented and possibly open-sourced for the research community interested in agent memory and representation learning.
- **Evaluation Toolkit:** A suite of analysis tools for latent spaces, including scripts or functions to visualize latent trajectories (using UMAP/t-SNE plots), to cluster latent points and compute metrics (silhouette scores, etc.), and to perform latent interpolations and reconstructions. This toolkit will help not only evaluate our model but could be useful for others building representation learning systems – essentially a set of diagnostics for “how good is my learned latent representation?”.
- **Annotated Dataset:** We will compile a dataset of the agent’s trajectories in the gridworld along with their latent encodings and relevant labels (important events, outcomes). This dataset (with latent vectors) can be valuable for anyone studying how to extract high-level events from raw agent experience, or for comparing different embedding approaches on a common ground. We will also label certain “experience events” (like reaching a goal, encountering an enemy, etc.) in the data to facilitate supervised evaluation of latent clustering.
- **Research Report and Case Studies:** A detailed report will be written, akin to an academic paper, containing the methodology, results, and analysis. This report will include:
    - **Visualization of the Latent Space:** e.g., 2D plots of latent points color-coded by scenario, showing that the model organizes experiences meaningfully (for instance, all goal-achieved states might cluster in one region, etc.). Temporal plots of a single episode’s latent path will illustrate how the agent’s journey is represented internally.
    - **Phase Transition Examples:** We will highlight cases where the agent’s behavior mode changes (such as exploring vs. exploiting) and show how this appears in latent space (perhaps a sharp turn in the latent trajectory or moving into a different cluster). This demonstrates the model’s ability to differentiate phases of behavior.
    - **Counterfactual Scenario Demonstrations:** We plan to include a few “dreamed up” examples – for instance, take a failed episode and alter its latent representation to make it successful, then decode it to a video or state sequence. We will present these before-and-after pairs to illustrate the agent’s imagination capability (e.g., *Figure: Actual trajectory vs. Altered trajectory in latent space that leads to a better outcome*). If possible, we’ll quantify that the imagined trajectory indeed achieves higher reward, etc.
    - **Quantitative Metrics:** Tables or charts summarizing reconstruction errors, clustering metrics (like NMI comparing latent clusters to true behavior categories), and perhaps performance on a downstream planning task using the latent model. This will back up our claims with data.
    - **Discussion of Latent Structure:** We will discuss what each dimension or part of the latent space might be encoding (if interpretable). For example, we might find one dimension strongly correlates with the agent’s energy level or with time within episode. Such findings will be reported as they give insight into how the model represents “the structure of experience.”
        
        The report will not only validate our approach but also serve as documentation for others interested in latent episodic modeling. We anticipate submitting portions of this work to relevant conferences in AI or cognitive robotics, as it has cross-disciplinary appeal (touching on memory, representation learning, and sequential decision making).
        

## **Anticipated Impact and Contributions**

If successful, this project will contribute significantly to the field of AI in the following ways:

- **Framework for Introspective Agents:** We introduce a novel framework that allows agents to **store and reason about their own experiences** in a rich, learned latent space. This goes beyond traditional reinforcement learning (which typically just learns a policy or value function) by giving the agent a form of memory that it can query and manipulate. It’s a step toward agents that have a form of *self-awareness* of their past, enabling capabilities like explanation (“here’s what I recall happening”) or strategy analysis (“let me imagine doing something differently and see if it could work”). This lays groundwork for incorporating human-like cognitive processes in agents, such as reflection and planning via internal simulation. Ultimately, it supports the argument that **counterfactual reasoning is a necessary component of general intelligence**, by providing a concrete way to implement that reasoning in machines.
- **Advances in Multimodal Representation Learning:** The project will demonstrate new methods to align and fuse multiple sensor modalities into a single representation without losing their unique information. The cross-attention fusion approach, if validated, could be applied to other multimodal learning problems (for example, robots that need to integrate vision, touch, and sound). We are effectively learning a latent world model that is *multi-channel*. By publishing our architecture and results, we give a blueprint for others to embed complex streams into VAEs. This complements existing work on world models by extending it to more complex agent internal states and goals. Additionally, our use of **reward-conditioned encoding** might inspire further research into how value information can shape representation learning (embedding what matters to the agent, not just what it perceives).
- **Hierarchical Memory Structures:** We contribute insight into how to build **hierarchical memories** in deep learning systems. Our approach combines time-scale abstraction with representational abstraction (low-level details up to high-level summaries). This could influence research in continual learning or lifelong learning, as it offers a way to compress long histories without forgetting important events. The concept of *episodes within episodes* (chunks that can be recalled or skipped) is an architectural contribution that could be extended to improve the efficiency of memory in long-horizon tasks. For example, instead of a transformer over millions of time steps, one could use our chunking approach to drastically reduce sequence length by summarizing parts of the sequence.
- **Evaluation Benchmarks for Latent Spaces:** By focusing on evaluating the **quality of latent experience spaces**, we help formalize what it means for an embedding to be “good” for cognitive tasks. We expect to show that certain metrics (like how well latent clusters align with meaningful events, or how smooth interpolation is) correlate with an agent’s ability to use those latents for planning. This could encourage a broader adoption of such evaluation metrics in representation learning research. Others building state representations for RL might, for instance, start checking latent traversability or semantic consistency as standard practice, which would be a valuable shift (currently, many works only check reward prediction or reconstruction error). Our project emphasizes *semantic and temporal fidelity* as first-class goals for representation learning.
- **Practical Tool for Agent Design:** In the long run, the latent experience model can serve as a **module in more complex cognitive architectures**. For example, one could plug this into a larger system where a planner module queries the latent memory to decide what to do, or an explanation module uses it to generate narratives about the agent’s behavior. We will demonstrate on a small scale how an agent might alter its latent memory to imagine outcomes. The concept of *imagination-guided planning* becomes feasible when you have a model that can generate realistic hypothetical scenarios on demand. We foresee this being a stepping stone to agents that can do lookahead simulations internally (like a mental rollout of “if I take this action, what might happen next?”) in a way that’s more abstract and flexible than classical model-based planning.

In summary, the project’s contributions are both foundational (proposing a new approach to structure an agent’s memories) and empirical (showing it works in a test domain and provides clear benefits). It brings together ideas from representation learning, sequential modeling, and even cognitive science (episodic memory, imagination) into a unified system. By the end, we expect to have a working demonstration of an agent with a form of **latent introspection**, which would be a notable milestone in moving AI systems from purely reactive paradigms towards ones that can **think about their own experiences**.

## **Potential Challenges and Risk Mitigation**

While the plan is ambitious, we have identified key challenges and have strategies to address each:

- **Challenge 1: Complexity of Multimodal Integration** – Fusing diverse data streams (images, states, rewards) into one latent representation is non-trivial. Each modality has different scale and noise characteristics. There is a risk that one modality (e.g. vision) might dominate the latent encoding or that the model fails to align them properly. *Mitigation:* We will use architectural features like modality-specific encoders and cross-attention to maintain the identity of each modality while learning the correlations between them. We’ll also apply **modality dropout** during training – sometimes dropping out a modality’s input – to ensure the latent space doesn’t become overly reliant on any single channel. If the fusion still underperforms, a fallback is to train a two-step model (first learn separate embeddings for each modality, then learn a second-stage network to merge those). This divide-and-conquer can simplify learning. Our evaluation metrics (reconstruction per modality, etc.) will quickly show if any modality is being ignored, and we can adjust training losses accordingly (e.g. increase weight on image reconstruction loss if visuals are not being encoded sharply).
- **Challenge 2: Trade-off Between Reconstruction and Imagination** – A model that perfectly reconstructs experiences might do so by overfitting or by using a very entangled latent code that isn’t easy to tweak for imagination. Conversely, a model that is very flexible in generating new scenarios might not faithfully remember exact details. Finding the sweet spot is challenging. *Mitigation:* We will tune the VAE’s β-value (which controls the strength of the KL divergence regularization) to balance fidelity and abstraction. A higher β forces more compression (hence more smoothness and generative ability) at the cost of detail, whereas a lower β favors reconstruction. We might employ a **β schedule** – start with β > 1 to encourage abstraction, then gradually decrease it to let the model capture more detail once the overall structure is learned. Also, our use of hierarchical latents inherently provides a solution: the higher latents can be more imaginative (since they capture abstract features, changing them yields plausible new combos) while lower latents ensure reconstruction of fine details. In evaluations, if we notice the model is too rigid (unable to produce novel variations), we will increase regularization; if it’s too loose (reconstructions poor), we reduce regularization or add more capacity. We will also test the extreme cases (pure autoencoder vs. very high β VAE) as baselines to see where we stand.
- **Challenge 3: Defining and Ensuring Semantic Consistency** – We talk about “semantically meaningful” changes in latent space, but quantifying this can be tricky. It’s possible the model might learn a latent space where some directions correspond to nonsense combinations of features. *Mitigation:* By design, our inclusion of reward and temporal structure should help – for example, one latent dimension might naturally align with time progression or reward level. To enforce semantic organization, the auxiliary tasks (like phase prediction) act as anchors: the model is literally trained to align part of its latent features with a known semantic target. Moreover, we will perform *qualitative checks* by examining decoded reconstructions from interpolated or randomly sampled latents to subjectively ensure they look valid. If we find, for instance, that interpolating between two states causes the agent to morph in an implausible way, we’ll investigate why – it might indicate the latent space is not smooth in that region, possibly due to training data gaps. Filling such gaps with more training samples or adding a slight **smoothness penalty** (like penalty on sudden changes in latent variables between consecutive time steps) could enforce more consistency. It’s also worth noting that semantic consistency might partly be ensured by the nature of the data – because we train on real (simulated) experiences, the model sees only physically possible combinations during training, which biases it to generate valid ones.
- **Challenge 4: Generalization and Scalability** – Since our experiments are in a custom gridworld, one might question if the learned latent model would generalize to other environments or more complex real-world data. If the training data is too narrow, the latent space may overfit to quirks of the gridworld. *Mitigation:* We will intentionally vary the gridworld scenarios during training – different layouts, different task objectives – to make the experience data more diverse. This will encourage the latent model to encode more general aspects (like spatial navigation or object interaction) rather than memorizing one maze. Additionally, the architecture itself is domain-agnostic (nothing in it is specific to gridworld), so in principle it can be transferred; to demonstrate some generalization, we might test the trained model on a held-out gridworld configuration or a slightly modified task to see if it still clusters similar experiences correctly. In terms of scalability, if we later apply this to higher-dimensional input (like complex 3D environments or real robot sensors), computational cost will rise. Our design of a hierarchical solution is partly to handle scalability – by compressing experiences, an agent could potentially handle very long histories by chunking them. As an extra extension, we proposed an **online updating** mechanism (where the model updates incrementally as new data comes in) – while we may not fully implement it in the grant timeframe, we will keep the code structure modular to allow future work to plug in online learning. The solo researcher nature of the project means we won’t scale to massive datasets here, but the methods used (stochastic training on replayed episodes) are standard and should carry over to larger scales with enough computing.
- **Challenge 5: Interpretability of Learned Representations** – High-dimensional latent spaces can be hard to interpret, especially when using deep neural nets. It might be difficult to explain *why* the model clusters experiences the way it does, or what a particular latent dimension means. This is not a direct requirement of the project, but since we aim for an introspective agent, some interpretability is desired (an agent should ideally explain its memory or counterfactuals). *Mitigation:* Our evaluation includes techniques to peek into the latent space structure. We’ll use correlation analysis between latent dimensions and known factors (like is there a dimension that almost directly corresponds to “has key or not” in the game?). If found, we can highlight those as interpretable features. If not, we might train a lightweight post-hoc model on the latent vectors to predict certain interpretable parameters, as a way to see if that information is present implicitly. In terms of the agent using this model, we can have the agent generate *natural language explanations* from its latent memory by training a simple decoder that produces a text description of the latent vector (this is speculative, but a small experiment we could try with an LLM or a trained captioning network – essentially treating the latent as input and outputting a sentence like “I remember being in a room with a key and I was low on health”). Even if we don’t fully achieve this within the project, we will outline it as a future direction. The hierarchical aspect also helps interpretability: the top layer of latent features, being more abstract, might be easier to map to concepts. For example, if one of the top latent variables consistently toggles between two values depending on whether the agent is in danger, that’s an interpretable “danger flag.” We will report such findings if they arise.

In conclusion, the challenges above are real, but each is met with a plan in our approach. By breaking the problem down (modality fusion, temporal encoding, hierarchy, etc.), we isolate where issues might occur and address them with known techniques or careful experimental design. The **risk is balanced** by the use of proven components (VAEs, Transformers, attention) and the flexibility of a simulation environment that we control (allowing us to generate more data or try different scenarios to troubleshoot the model). The novelty of the project does mean we might encounter unexpected hurdles, but the evaluation-driven workflow ensures we catch problems early and iterate. Even partial success – say we achieve a good multimodal encoding and temporal continuity, but hierarchical abstraction is less effective – would still yield valuable insights to report. Given the potential payoff of agents that can introspect and reason about “what could have been,” these challenges are worth tackling. The result will be a significant step toward AI systems with richer cognitive abilities, satisfying the grant’s vision of innovative, high-impact research in intelligent systems.

## **Prior Work**

As part of an earlier investigation into agent cognition and behavior modeling, we explored how embedding techniques could be used to understand and visualize the diversity and structure of agent experiences within a simulated environment. This research, published informally under the title *Visualizing Agent Experiences*, examined the use of high-dimensional state embeddings to represent agents’ trajectories and internal states over time. By applying sentence-transformer models and dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE, we analyzed how agent behavior formed distinct patterns in latent space.

The results revealed that some agents exhibited tight, centralized clusters of embeddings, indicating localized or repetitive behavior, while others showed broad dispersion or multi-cluster structures, corresponding to transitions between distinct behavioral modes. In a case study of one such agent, we identified clear phases in its operation based on shifts in spatial location, resource levels, and health status. These clusters corresponded meaningfully to different operational states, validating the utility of embedding space as a lens for interpreting agent dynamics.

Several key insights emerged from this work:

- **Embedding spread correlates with experiential diversity**: Agents that explored more of the environment exhibited more dispersed and varied embedding structures.
- **Latent clusters reflect narrative structure**: The temporal and behavioral segmentation of agent experience into latent clusters suggested a possible foundation for introspective or self-narrative capacities.
- **Agent individuality is expressible in latent space**: Each agent exhibited a unique “signature” of experience, opening the door to questions of identity and differentiation within multi-agent systems.

These findings motivated our current proposal. If embeddings can faithfully represent the structure of agent experience, they may also serve as manipulable substrates for counterfactual reasoning—allowing agents to not only recall and interpret their past, but also to imagine alternative futures or reframe past events. This shift from observation to simulation forms the conceptual bridge between past and present work.

The techniques developed in this earlier project—state weighting, embedding generation, visualization, and behavioral interpretation—directly inform the methodological foundations of the current research. More broadly, this work reinforced the idea that introspective mechanisms in artificial systems may begin not with language or logic, but with the ability to model and manipulate structured representations of experience.
