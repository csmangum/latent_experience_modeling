# Research Phases for Latent Experience Modeling

Below is a logical sequence of research phases that collectively advance the latent-experience-modeling agenda.  Each phase builds on the foundations laid in the previous ones and prepares essential capabilities or validation steps for the next.

1. **Modality Characterization & Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   • Profile each sensory, proprioceptive, internal-state, and reward channel.  
   • Identify redundancy, complementarity, temporal rhythms, and semantic value.  
   • Establish data standards and diagnostics that will guide later fusion choices.

2. **Baseline Representation & Reconstruction Models**  
   • Implement simple concatenation/autoencoder and unimodal baselines.  
   • Quantify reconstruction fidelity per modality and set performance floors.  
   • Validate data pipelines, loss functions, and evaluation tooling.

3. **Multimodal Fusion & Cross-Attention Encoding**  
   • Develop joint encoders with early-, late-, and bottleneck-attention fusion.  
   • Incorporate reward/affect signals as a first-class latent axis.  
   • Compare fusion variants for robustness, modality importance, and interpretability.

4. **Temporal Dynamics & Continuity Modeling**  
   • Introduce sequence encoders (TCN, RNN, Transformer) to capture time dependencies.  
   • Enforce latent smoothness and trajectory alignment; integrate Time2Vec or positional embeddings.  
   • Evaluate multi-step prediction, latent rollouts, and temporal coherence.

5. **Hierarchical Abstraction & Event Segmentation**  
   • Build hierarchical VAEs / HM-RNNs for multi-scale latent structure.  
   • Learn automatic event boundaries, episodic summaries, and conceptual codes.  
   • Add self-supervised auxiliary tasks (phase, reward, event prediction) to shape abstractions.

6. **Latent Space Evaluation & Diagnostics**  
   • Apply comprehensive reconstruction, clustering, traversability, and smoothness metrics.  
   • Deploy probing classifiers and contrastive tests for semantic consistency.  
   • Iterate on architecture based on diagnostic feedback.

7. **Counterfactual Generation & Imaginative Manipulation**  
   • Enable latent arithmetic, interpolation, and targeted edits for "what-if" scenarios.  
   • Validate plausibility via decoding, rule-based checks, and human assessment.  
   • Demonstrate internal simulation of alternative outcomes.

8. **Generalization, Robustness & Online Adaptation**  
   • Test transfer to novel environments, tasks, and modality drop-outs.  
   • Introduce incremental learning and lightweight personalization layers.  
   • Monitor latent drift and retention under continual updates.

9. **Interpretability, Visualization & Introspection Tooling**  
   • Build interactive dashboards for latent trajectories, attention maps, and abstraction drill-down.  
   • Provide query, encode, decode, and counterfactual APIs for human and agent use.  
   • Conduct human-in-the-loop reviews to name and validate latent dimensions.

10. **Downstream Integration & Demonstration**  
    • Embed latent model in planning, memory retrieval, and explanation pipelines.  
    • Benchmark policy learning efficiency and introspective reasoning benefits.  
    • Package evaluation suite, datasets, and documentation for open release.
