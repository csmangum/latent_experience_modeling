This work introduces a comprehensive framework for **hierarchical abstraction learning** in minimal computational agents operating within custom simulation environments. It unifies architectural innovations, representational goals, and evaluation protocols into a cohesive system designed to support introspection, semantic generalization, and behavior signature formation. The following contributions are novel with respect to both scope and depth:

---

### üß† **1. End-to-End Hierarchical Abstraction Pipeline for Minimal Agents**

We present a fully integrated system that spans:

- **Event boundary detection**,
- **Hierarchical latent encoding (HVAE)**,
- **Temporal attention pooling**,
- **Self-supervised semantic shaping**, and
- **Meta-embedding generation**.

This pipeline is designed from first principles for minimal agents‚Äîentities with limited sensing, action, and memory‚Äîunlike most abstraction models designed for rich perceptual environments.

### üß© **2. Unified Framework for Multi-Timescale and Multi-Modality Abstractions**

We propose a modular structure that supports:

- Cross-level consistency (**timestep ‚Üî episode ‚Üî conceptual level**),
- Joint temporal and modality-aware pooling,
- Dynamic interpolation and drill-down/roll-up traversals across abstraction layers.

This architecture ensures that abstractions are not only semantically meaningful but also **computationally traversable** and **exploratively queryable**.

### üß≤ **3. Contrastive and Auxiliary Learning for Structured Abstraction Emergence**

We introduce a layered self-supervision strategy combining:

- **Auxiliary tasks** (e.g., phase prediction, reward anticipation),
- **Contrastive learning** (InfoNCE, SimCLR) guided by temporal and conceptual similarity,
- **Semantic prompting** to guide latent alignment with interpretable concepts.

This results in **semantically grounded, task-relevant embeddings** that remain robust across tasks and environments.

### üîç **4. Meta-Embedding as Behavioral Identity (‚ÄúSelf-Signature‚Äù)**

We define and operationalize the notion of a **meta-embedding** that captures:

- Persistent agent behaviors across episodes,
- Agent identity and style,
- Internal policy traits that generalize across contexts.

This abstraction serves as a **behavioral fingerprint** for agents, enabling personalized reasoning, adaptation, and analysis.

---

### üß™ **5. Hierarchical Evaluation Protocols for Abstraction Validity**

We introduce a novel **multi-level validation suite**, which includes:

- Cross-layer reconstruction metrics,
- Cluster purity vs. semantic labels,
- Latent coherence scores for interpolation and rollout,
- Cross-modal abstraction alignment,
- Human-in-the-loop interpretability audits.

These evaluations support **rigorous, reproducible measurement** of the semantic quality and usability of learned abstractions.

### üñºÔ∏è **6. Introspective Visualization Toolkit for Hierarchical Latent Spaces**

We provide a browser-based and/or notebook-based **interactive visualization system** that allows:

- Semantic exploration of latent spaces,
- Temporal and conceptual trajectory tracing,
- Hierarchical clustering visualization,
- Live drill-down and roll-up of latent episodes.

This enables **transparent inspection and debugging** of abstraction models in real time, which is rare in agent-based learning systems.

### üîÑ **7. First Application of Hierarchical Abstraction Learning to Custom Minimal-Agent Simulation**

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive system that:

- Builds abstractions across semantic, temporal, and identity dimensions,
- Operates within a lightweight, custom agent simulation environment,
- Is compatible with multi-agent or resource-constrained settings.

By working from low-level step data up to long-term conceptual regularities, we bridge the gap between **mechanistic behavior** and **emergent meaning**.
