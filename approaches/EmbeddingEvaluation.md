# Embedding Evaluation Plan: Deep Research and Examples

## 1. Reconstruction Fidelity

**Goal:** Ensure the learned embedding can accurately reconstruct the original multi-modal experience. This involves evaluating how well each modality (visual, proprioceptive, actions, reward) is encoded and decoded by the VAE.

**Methods & Metrics:** In vision, *pixel-level reconstruction error* (e.g. MSE) is a basic metric, but it often fails to capture perceptual quality. Thus, structural similarity indices (SSIM) are commonly reported alongside MSE to assess image reconstruction fidelity. For internal state (proprioceptive) data and continuous sensors, mean squared or absolute errors are used, while for categorical variables (e.g. discrete actions) one can report classification accuracy of the decoder’s output against the original input. Reward signals predicted by the model can be evaluated via regression error (MSE/RMSE) or classification accuracy if rewards are discrete. These metrics provide baseline *reconstruction accuracy benchmarks*. For example, in **world model** architectures, the VAE component is trained to minimize the pixel reconstruction loss in addition to a KL regularizer. Ha and Schmidhuber’s foundational *World Models* (2018) used a VAE “Vision Model” to compress game frames and demonstrated that decoding from the latent yielded recognizable reconstructions of the original frames. High reconstruction fidelity was found to be critical: blurry or noisy reconstructions indicate the latent code is losing important information, which can degrade downstream policy learning. Ensuring crisp reconstructions (high SSIM, low MSE) was thus emphasized as a best practice in world-model agents.

**Experiments:** Compare reconstruction of full sequences vs single timestep. For instance, one can feed an entire trajectory through the autoencoder and compare reconstructed video to the original (using video-level PSNR/SSIM), versus reconstructing frame-by-frame. Hierarchical VAEs may show that higher-level abstract latents reconstruct a *coarse* version of the input, whereas lower-level latents add detail. An experiment could ablate the hierarchy: measure reconstruction error when using only the top-level latents versus all latents. This tests how abstraction affects fidelity. In practice, researchers observe a trade-off: increasing the weight on the KL term or using a β-VAE yields more abstract/disentangled latents at the cost of higher reconstruction error. The deliverables here include quantitative reconstruction metrics for each modality (e.g. image SSIM ~0.9, joint-angle MSE, action prediction accuracy) and a *visual comparison toolkit* to qualitatively inspect original vs reconstructed outputs side by side. Such toolkits are common in VAE evaluations to verify that reconstructions preserve crucial structures (for instance, comparing original game frames to VAE-reconstructed frames in CarRacing or VizDoom).

## 2. Latent Traversability

**Goal:** Assess whether the learned latent space is smooth and supports meaningful interpolation between experiences. A *traversable* latent space means that drawing a path between two latent points yields a gradual, coherent transformation in decoded observations, rather than unrealistic jumps. This property is expected in VAEs, whose continuous latent spaces facilitate smooth interpolation.

**Methods:** Perform **latent interpolation** experiments: take two distinct latent encodings (e.g. from two different states or behaviors) and generate intermediate latents by linear interpolation or spherical interpolation. Decode these intermediate points to see if they produce sensible intermediate observations. For example, if one latent corresponds to an agent at location A and another to location B, decoding halfway in latent space should show the agent in an intermediate position. VAEs are designed to encourage such continuity – as noted in the original VAE paper, the latent space is generally *continuous and smooth*, enabling meaningful random sampling and interpolation. In practice, many generative models demonstrate this by creating traversal animations or grids. It’s important to verify that no *discontinuities* exist: if small latent changes cause drastic output changes, the embedding might not have learned a proper manifold. Metrics can quantify this: one can measure **latent trajectory curvature** – e.g. take a sequence of latent encodings and ensure the second derivative (change in direction) along the decoded trajectory is small, indicating a smooth path. Recent representation learning research suggests examining local neighborhoods in latent space to ensure nearby latents correspond to similar states or Q-values. *Latent continuity metrics* evaluate whether small movements in $z$ result in small, consistent changes in decoded observations or predictions. For instance, Le Lan *et al.* (2021) define continuity tests for RL representations by checking that nearby latent points yield similar policy outputs or value estimates. Another approach is **semantic coherence scoring**: assign each latent a semantic label (if available, e.g. “walking” vs “running” behavior) and interpolate – intermediate latents can be scored by a classifier or human judgment to see if they maintain coherent semantics. If an interpolation between “walking” and “running” yields a plausible “jogging” sequence, that indicates good semantic continuity.

**Experiments:** One experiment could take pairs of latent codes corresponding to distinct behaviors in the GridWorld (say one for an agent navigating to a goal optimally, and another for the agent meandering). Interpolate between these latent codes and decode the agent’s trajectory. Evaluate *realism* (do intermediate trajectories still obey environment physics and look natural?) and *semantic coherence* (does the behavior gradually change from one to the other?). Ideally, the latent space will allow **meaningful analogies** and arithmetic as well – e.g., in generative models it’s known that latent vectors can capture concepts linearly (classic example: in a GAN’s latent space, *vector(“smiling woman”) – vector(“neutral woman”) + vector(“neutral man”)* produces a *“smiling man”*). We can attempt analogous manipulations in the agent’s latent space (e.g. latent encoding of “with door open” minus “with door closed” plus a new scene might yield that new scene with the door open – a form of semantic latent arithmetic). Successful semantic vector arithmetic would demonstrate that the latent space encodes high-level factors in a linear fashion. **Continuity metrics** such as the average change in decoded observation per unit change in latent (measured by image differences or state variable differences) can be reported. As a deliverable, a *traversability testbed* should be created – a script or notebook that allows selecting two latent states and visualizing a decoded interpolation sequence. Additionally, providing quantitative measures (like curvature or an interpolation coherence score) will help benchmark this aspect across model variants.

## 3. Clustering and Segmentation Analysis

**Goal:** Determine if the learned embeddings naturally cluster into meaningful groups – for example, do similar behaviors or environment contexts end up close together in latent space? A good representation might segment experiences by high-level situation or task without explicit supervision.

**Methods:** Use **dimensionality reduction** techniques (like UMAP or t-SNE) to project the high-dimensional latents into 2D or 3D for visualization. Qualitatively, one can inspect if distinct clusters emerge (and if they correspond to interpretable categories, e.g. “state near goal” vs “state far from goal” grouping). Prior work often visualizes latent spaces in this way – *Lesort et al.* (2018) recommend embedding visualization as a qualitative check, noting that t-SNE/UMAP plots can reveal if the representation has organized the state space meaningfully. Beyond visual inspection, we should compute **quantitative clustering metrics**. If ground-truth semantic labels are available for each state (e.g. we tag each GridWorld state with a human-interpretable label like “in danger” vs “safe”, or which room the agent is in), we can compute **cluster purity**: run a clustering algorithm (k-means or similar) on the latent vectors and see how homogeneous the resulting clusters are with respect to the semantic labels. A high purity (or NMI – normalized mutual information between clusters and true classes) would indicate the latent space segregates those categories. Even without ground truth labels, intrinsic clustering quality can be assessed by metrics like the **Silhouette score**, **Davies–Bouldin index**, and **Calinski–Harabasz index**. These metrics examine the compactness of clusters and their separation from each other. For instance, the silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1 (with higher values meaning data points are much closer to their own cluster centroid than to others) and is a widely used indicator of clustering consistency. In representation learning research, it’s common to report such scores when claiming that an unsupervised embedding finds meaningful groupings. Zhang *et al.* (2012) even proposed a manifold preservation metric (NIEQA) to quantify how well a learned embedding preserves the neighborhood structure of the original data – relevant if our simulation has known underlying state variables.

**Experiments:** Apply k-means to latent vectors collected from various episodes and compute the above cluster metrics. Do this for different levels of abstraction (if using a hierarchical VAE, you can cluster using only the top-level latent vs the bottom-level latent to see which yields more meaningful groupings). Also test clustering stability: if you slightly perturb input states (e.g. add sensor noise) and encode them, do they still fall into the same cluster? This checks *robustness* of clustering. Another experiment: color a 2D t-SNE plot of latent points by some known property (e.g. the true distance to goal or the current high-level phase of the task) to see if those properties correspond to visible clusters or gradients in the latent space. Prior studies have done similar analyses; for example, Anand et al. (2019) evaluated Atari state embeddings by projecting them and observing clusters corresponding to game level segments. We can compute **purity scores**: if we label each latent by a discrete tag (like which of N behaviors the agent is executing), purity will be the fraction of states in each cluster that share the majority tag. Additionally, report Silhouette, Davies–Bouldin, and Calinski–Harabasz scores for the chosen number of clusters (these indices are standard and allow comparisons – e.g. a recent medical representation learning paper used all three metrics to evaluate latent clustering performance). A *clustering evaluation toolkit* will be delivered, containing scripts to perform these analyses and perhaps an interactive dashboard to explore clusters (e.g. clicking on a cluster to see example states or reconstructions from it).

## 4. Semantic Consistency and Perturbation Robustness

**Goal:** Ensure that small perturbations in the latent space correspond to *small, semantically consistent changes* in the decoded outputs. In other words, the representation shouldn’t be brittle – similar states should have similar embeddings (local smoothness), and if we jiggle an embedding slightly, the decoded experience or the agent’s interpreted state should not change drastically or become incoherent. This also relates to *disentanglement*: we’d like changes along one latent dimension to produce specific, understandable changes in the output (e.g. changing just the agent’s orientation without affecting its position).

**Methods:** Conduct **perturbation experiments** in latent space. Take an encoded latent $z$ and add a small random delta $\epsilon$ to it (or perturb one specific dimension of $z$ by a small amount). Decode both the original $z$ and the perturbed $z+\epsilon$. Have human evaluators or an automated metric judge the semantic difference between the two decoded observations. Ideally, the difference is minor and corresponds to a logical change (e.g. the agent moved a tiny bit or the lighting changed slightly) rather than a drastic change (e.g. a completely different scene). This aligns with the *temporal coherence* prior in robotics: states that are near each other in time (hence likely similar) should have nearby representations. Jonschkowski & Brock (2015) explicitly encoded such “robotic priors” for state learning, including **smoothness** (small changes in sensor input result in small changes in state) and **repeatability** (revisiting the same state yields the same representation). We can enforce or evaluate these by checking that $d(z(x), z(x'))$ is small for similar observations $x, x'$. A quantitative approach is a **local Lipschitz test**: take a state $x$ and a slightly different state $x'$ (perhaps the agent moved one step, or added minimal noise to sensors) and compute the distance between their latent codes $|z(x) - z(x')|$. Compare this to a measure of the true state difference (like the actual change in underlying state variables). We expect a roughly proportional relationship if the embedding is consistent (this was termed the *proportionality prior* by Jonschkowski (2015)).

Another method is **retrieval-based consistency**: for a given perturbed latent $z+\epsilon$, retrieve the $k$ nearest neighbor latents from a dataset (using Euclidean or cosine distance) and see if their decoded observations are semantically similar to the perturbed output. If an embedding is robust, a slight perturbation should not jump to a completely different region of the latent space; its nearest neighbors should be originally similar states. Precision@K and recall@K can be used here: e.g., define a semantic criterion (like same room or same task phase) and measure what fraction of the $k$ nearest latent neighbors of a perturbed point share the criterion with the original. A high precision means perturbations stay within the same semantic category. This approach was used in some state representation learning works – **Sermanet et al. (2017)**, for instance, used nearest-neighbor consistency as a metric, requiring that frames that look similar have embeddings that are close (they visualized patches whose nearest latent neighbors were from the same class).

We can also employ **contrastive evaluation**: take two states with known semantic difference (e.g. one with a door open, one with it closed) and examine the latent distance between them. Do the same for two states that differ in a trivial way (e.g. same state but with slight sensor noise). A good embedding will yield larger latent distance for the significant semantic change than for the trivial change. In effect, we expect latent distance to reflect meaningful *semantic distance*. This can be checked by rank correlation between latent distances and some ground-truth semantic distance measure defined on our dataset. For instance, *Lesort et al.* (2017) evaluated how well latent distances preserve original state-space distances on a simple robot dataset, by measuring if nearest neighbors in latent correspond to nearest in true state space.

**Experiments:** (a) *Qualitative perturbation*: Pick a latent encoding of a particular state (say, the agent in a gridworld room). Add Gaussian noise of small magnitude to the latent and decode multiple times. Verify (with human inspection) that the decoded images all depict essentially the same scenario with minor variations. If the agent suddenly appears in a different room due to tiny latent changes, that’s a red flag. We can systematically do this across many samples and have a human rate whether the original and perturbed reconstructions depict the “same situation.” (b) *Semantic retrieval test*: For each latent $z$, find the nearest neighbor $z_\text{NN}$ in the training latent set. Check if the original observation corresponding to $z_\text{NN}$ shares key semantic attributes with the observation for $z$ (for example, both are at the same goal location or both involve the same action sequence). We can measure the percentage of cases where this holds (this is essentially precision@1 for semantic similarity). (c) *Linear probe consistency*: Following the Atari benchmark by Anand et al. (2019), train simple linear models to predict ground-truth factors (like agent coordinates, enemy count, etc.) from the latent representation. High accuracy in these predictions means the latent changes in a way consistent with changes in those factors – indicating semantic consistency. Anand et al. demonstrated this by showing their learned embedding could linearly predict various annotated state variables in Atari with good accuracy. (d) *Perturbation vs. semantic change curve*: plot how latent distance grows as we gradually morph one state to a very different state (e.g. move an agent bit by bit to the other side of the map). Ideally, the latent distance should grow roughly monotonically with true distance, rather than plateauing or jumping. The deliverables will include a **semantic consistency suite** – possibly a small report or tool that given two observations (or an observation and a perturbed version), outputs the latent distances, nearest neighbors, and any semantic mismatch alerts. We will also provide a qualitative report with examples (images of decoded perturbations side-by-side, with human commentary on whether the changes make sense).

## 5. Temporal Structure Evaluation

**Goal:** Validate that the latent space properly captures temporal dynamics – that is, sequences of latents respect the true temporal evolution of the environment. If the agent’s internal model explicitly encodes time or transitions (e.g. via an RNN or state-space model on latents), we want to ensure *temporal coherence*: a sequence of latent states should unfold consistently with the sequence of actual states. This is especially relevant since we are using a **hierarchical VAE** likely coupled with a temporal model.

**Methods:** One direct test is **trajectory reconstruction quality**. We can attempt to reconstruct not just individual observations but entire sequences from latent trajectories. For example, feed an actual sequence of observations into the encoder to get $z_1, z_2, ..., z_T$. Then decode the full sequence $(z_1,...,z_T)$ into a sequence of observations $\hat{x}_1,...,\hat{x}*T$ and compare it to the original sequence $x_1,...,x_T$. This can be measured by sequence-level metrics like Fréchet Video Distance (for video realism) or simply averaging frame-wise SSIM over the trajectory. A high-quality world model should reconstruct rollouts that look realistic and temporally smooth. In world-model literature, researchers often show videos of model-predicted rollouts alongside ground truth. For example, Ha & Schmidhuber’s world model could produce entire dreamed episodes in a car-racing game, and the dream trajectories, when decoded, resembled plausible game footage. Another method is **temporal coherence metrics**: e.g., measure the difference $|z*{t+1} - z_t|$ for successive time steps and check if large jumps in latent space correspond to actual significant events in the environment. If the latent space is well-behaved, most time-adjacent latent differences should be small (due to small environmental changes) except when an actual abrupt event happens (like episode reset or a sudden change). This aligns with the idea of *temporal smoothness* that many representation learning algorithms build in (e.g. via temporal continuity loss).

Additionally, we can evaluate the **model’s predictive ability**: use the learned latent dynamics (if we have one, like an RNN prior) to predict the next latent state $\tilde{z}*{t+1}$ from $z_t$ and action $a_t$, then decode $\tilde{x}*{t+1}$ and compare to actual $x_{t+1}$. Metrics like next-step prediction accuracy (for discrete events) or mean error (for continuous observations) quantify how well the temporal structure is captured. *Hafner et al.* (2019) emphasized multi-step prediction: their PlaNet model optimized a latent overshooting loss to improve multi-step rollout accuracy. We should similarly evaluate multi-step predictions: starting from an initial latent $z_0$ and a sequence of actions, roll out the latent dynamics for $H$ steps (without peeking at the true observations) and decode the imagined trajectory. Compare this with the ground truth trajectory via average error per step. A gradually increasing error over time is expected (due to compounding model error), but the horizon at which the model’s predictions diverge catastrophically is a useful measure of temporal coherence length.

**Experiments:** (a) *Temporal interpolation:* Take two states from different times in an episode (e.g. beginning vs end of a trajectory). Instead of interpolating in latent *space* (like in section 2), interpolate in *time* by actually stepping through the environment and/or the model. We can create an latent trajectory by encoding an actual episode (which ensures temporal correctness), and another trajectory by interpolating directly between the start and end latent (which might yield an unnatural path). By decoding both, we can see if the model inherently respects temporal constraints. The expectation is that the actual latent trajectory produces a sensible video, whereas a naïve interpolation in latent space (not following dynamics) might produce a weird morphing sequence that is not physically possible. (b) *Rollout fidelity:* For various initial states, use the model (latent dynamics + decoder) to generate $N$-step rollouts. Compute fidelity metrics: e.g., the percentage of frames where the model’s prediction is recognizably correct for $1,2,\ldots,N$ steps ahead. We might report that the model can predict 5 steps with, say, >90% SSIM, but by 20 steps the generated sequence drifts off. Such results have been reported in model-based RL papers – PlaNet and Dreamer showed that latent dynamics can correctly predict several seconds of future in simulation, but eventually diverge. (c) *Temporal latent distance vs. time:* Plot the latent distance $|z_t - z_{t+k}|$ as a function of time separation $k$ for a set of episodes. This should correlate with how “different” states are after k steps. If the latent is well-behaved, this curve might increase with $k$ (up to a point, then saturating if the task has some cyclic or bounded nature). (d) *Time-step prediction accuracy:* If the environment has a known short-term event (e.g. a moving object that alternates positions), we can specifically test if the model correctly captures that. For instance, if at time $t$ a door is closed and at $t+1$ it opens (given an open-door action), does the latent prediction correctly represent an open door (which we’d verify by decoding or by a classifier on the latent)? We might train a simple decoder or probe that looks at $z$ and predicts if the door is open, and check if the predicted $\tilde{z}_{t+1}$ flips that indicator when it should.

The deliverables include a **temporal coherence evaluation module** – likely a set of scripts that automate rollout generation and compute errors at each step, plus visualizations (e.g. a side-by-side video of actual vs model-predicted trajectories). Numerically, we will report things like *n-step prediction error curves*, and perhaps a “half-life” statistic (the time horizon at which prediction error exceeds a threshold). Demonstrating temporal embedding quality might also involve showing that the latent space has “remembered” what happened earlier: e.g. two latent trajectories that diverged and later reconverged to a similar observation may not overlap exactly if the model encodes some memory (which it should in a POMDP). Checking that would validate if the latent encodes sufficient history.

## 6. Hierarchical Abstraction Validation

**Goal:** If our VAE is hierarchical (multiple layers of latent variables), we need to verify that each layer is capturing a different level of abstraction in a meaningful way. Typically, lower-level latents capture detail (e.g. pixel-level or instantaneous information) while higher-level latents capture abstract or slow features (e.g. the high-level context or goal). We want to demonstrate that the hierarchy is *meaningful and interpretable*.

**Methods:** **Layer-wise evaluation:** Treat each latent level in isolation. For the lowest-level latent (closest to data), evaluate reconstruction fidelity and clustering as we have above. Then do the same for the top-level latent by *only decoding from the top latent*. Many hierarchical VAEs allow decoding from various levels (e.g. decoding using only the top latent gives a coarse reconstruction). We expect that using only the top latent will reconstruct the *broad strokes* correctly but miss fine details, indicating it encodes an abstract summary. For example, a hierarchical VAE on images might decode a blurred outline when only the highest latent is used. Quantitatively, one can measure reconstruction error using only layer-$L$ latent versus using all layers. A significant increase in error when high-level latent is used alone implies it’s not storing detailed information – which is good, as it means it’s more abstract. We can also examine how clustering differs at different layers. Perhaps the top latent clusters by scene or task, whereas the bottom latent clusters by immediate sensory patterns. This can be checked by computing cluster metrics on each. If semantic tags (like “type of task”) are better separated in the top latent space than the bottom, that confirms a meaningful hierarchy.

Another technique is **cross-level traversability**: change a high-level latent while keeping low-level ones fixed (or vice versa) and decode. For instance, take an encoded state, then swap out only the top-level latent with that from another state, and decode. Does the output reflect a *high-level substitution* (e.g. the background or goal changed, but small details remain from the original)? This is analogous to **factor swapping** experiments used in disentanglement research: one can combine latents from two sources to see if high-level factors can be recombined. If our hierarchy is functioning, swapping high-level latents should change abstract aspects while preserving low-level details (and vice versa). For example, in a 2D gridworld, perhaps the top latent encodes which maze layout is being used, and the bottom latent encodes the agent’s position. Swapping top latents between two encodings would place the agent’s position from state A into the maze layout of state B. We can decode that and see if that interpretation holds (the deliverable could include such swapped reconstructions). Recent hierarchical generative models explicitly aim for such factorization; e.g., **Ladder VAEs** and other deep VAEs can disentangle “shared vs private” information across layers. Guerrero-López *et al.* (2022) describe a multi-modal hierarchical VAE where higher latent layers capture shared concepts across modalities while lower latents capture modality-specific details. Validating our model might involve similar reasoning: does the top layer capture something common across all inputs at a high level?

**Human interpretability assessments:** This involves *qualitative review* of what each layer is doing. One approach is to visualize the learned features: for example, take one dimension of the top latent and vary it while decoding to see what changes in the output. Present these to human observers to identify the factor. If a certain top-latent dimension consistently toggles whether the agent is carrying a key (for instance), then we have an interpretable factor. This approach is inspired by **β-VAE** work (Higgins et al. 2017) which did latent traversals and saw, e.g., one latent controlling object size, another controlling position, etc. Here we apply it per layer: we might find lower-layer latents affect subtle visual aspects (like color or exact position), while higher-layer latents affect big structural aspects (like level layout or overall strategy). Another approach: *probe classifiers* on each layer for various known attributes. If we train a classifier on the top latent to predict a high-level property (like “task type”) and on the bottom latent to predict the same, and the top latent yields much higher accuracy, that means the info is largely stored in the top. This technique was used by **Zhang et al. (2024)** who probed unsupervised RL representations with lightweight classifiers to see which info is in the representation. We expect that high-level abstract info is more linearly decodable from higher layers.

**Experiments:** (a) *Level-wise decoding:* Manually disable portions of the decoder to see the contribution of each latent level. For a hierarchical VAE, one can feed zeros for the lower latent and only use the top latent through the top decoder layer. Generate outputs and compare. For instance, feed only high-level latent: maybe the gridworld’s general layout appears but the agent’s precise location is blurred or averaged out. Conversely, feed only low-level latent (with a fixed high-level): maybe you get local consistency but random global context. (b) *Cross-level consistency:* Check that if we generate a sample using inconsistent combinations (like a top latent from one context and a bottom latent from another), the model’s confidence (or reconstruction loss) is lower – ideally the VAE should assign low probability to incompatible combinations, enforcing that top and bottom latents remain coherent. Some hierarchical VAEs use *coherence penalties* to ensure layers work together (e.g., forcing the higher layer to capture global factors that make lower-level reconstructions easier). We can measure something like the ELBO or reconstruction error for hybrid latent combinations to see if the model “detects” inconsistency. (c) *Case studies for interpretability:* Pick a couple of latent dimensions at each level and do a grid of traversals (vary latent dim from -2σ to +2σ while keeping others fixed) and decode. Include these in a report for human judgment: have domain experts label what each varying latent *appears* to do (“latent 5 at level 3 seems to control agent’s goal location”). This was done in some interpretable representation works and can yield anecdotal evidence of semantics (e.g., **DeepMind’s multi-level VAE** in “Learning by Observation” found specific units corresponding to object presence). (d) *Information content per layer:* Compute the mutual information between each latent layer and various aspects of the data. For example, top-layer latent vs the reward achieved in that episode; bottom-layer latent vs instantaneous sensor readings. If the hierarchy is meaningful, the top layer might have higher MI with cumulative reward or high-level event variables, whereas the bottom layer has higher MI with immediate sensor pixels or positions.

Deliverables include a **hierarchical embedding evaluation report** documenting these findings. We expect to show, for instance, that *higher layers are more interpretable*: maybe a 2D plot of top-layer latents colored by scenario shows distinct groups (indicating different scenarios separated) whereas a similar plot for bottom-layer latents is more mixed (because bottom layer is busy with fine details). We also aim to demonstrate at least one clear example of interpretability at a high layer (e.g., “latent neuron $z^3_2$ corresponds to whether an enemy is present”), akin to case studies reported in hierarchical generative modeling literature. The framework from **Guerrero-López et al. (2022)** can inspire our approach – they used Automatic Relevance Determination on weight matrices to see which global latent dimensions explained which views, improving interpretability. Similarly, we might inspect decoder weights from each latent to see if, say, top latent primarily feeds into certain parts of the observation (like background vs foreground). The ultimate goal is to verify that the hierarchical design is not just adding complexity but indeed separating concerns (low-level vs high-level information) in a useful way.

## 7. Counterfactual and Imaginative Generation Validation

**Goal:** Test the model’s ability to generate *novel plausible scenarios* by manipulating the latent representation – essentially, **imagination** and **counterfactual reasoning**. Can we use the embedding to answer “what if” questions, such as “What if the agent had taken a different action?” or “What if the environment had a different configuration?” This evaluates the generative power and the causal understanding encoded in the latent space.

**Methods:** **Counterfactual manipulation experiments:** Use latent arithmetic or traversals to create hypothetical scenarios, and then decode them to verify plausibility. For example, take the latent representation of a given state and apply a transformation corresponding to a known change (if we can identify one). Perhaps we find that adding a certain vector $\delta$ to the latent corresponds to “adding an obstacle in front of the agent” (we might discover $\delta$ by taking the difference of latents from states with and without an obstacle). Then apply that $\delta$ to a new state’s latent to imagine “what if an obstacle were here”. The decoder’s output can be checked – does it indeed show an obstacle added in the new state? This kind of *latent vector arithmetic* for counterfactuals has been explored in generative modeling. In NLP and vision, *causal latent variable models* allow modifying one factor while keeping others fixed. Our multi-modal VAE could potentially isolate some factors (especially with a disentanglement prior or with labeled factors during training). We should leverage any factorized structure: e.g., if one part of the latent is designated for environment configuration and another for agent state, then generating counterfactuals like “same agent state in a different environment” becomes as simple as swapping those parts.

**Semantic validation of generated counterfactuals:** Once we generate a counterfactual output (decoded observation), we must assess if it’s *semantically coherent and follows domain logic*. Human judgment is a gold standard here: have experts or annotators evaluate whether the imagined scenario is realistic and internally consistent (no physics violations, etc.). We can also do automated checks: if the environment has rules, we can build a validator that flags violations (e.g., in gridworld, two agents in one cell, or an object floating in an impossible way). Another approach is to use a pre-trained classifier or differentiable simulator as a “critic” – for example, train a model to classify whether an observation belongs to the real environment distribution or is unrealistic. If our counterfactual decodings mostly pass this classifier as “realistic”, that’s a good sign. In fact, **VAEs are well-suited for counterfactual generation** because they learn the data distribution; prior work on counterfactual explanations has used VAEs to generate plausible alternative inputs that achieve a different outcome. For instance, Pawlowski et al. (2020) note that VAEs can modify input features in a way that stays in-distribution, which is crucial for valid counterfactuals. We will follow a similar logic: ensure our latent manipulations keep the output on the manifold of valid states.

We can define a **counterfactual success metric**: e.g., if we attempt to modify a certain property via latent manipulation, how often is that property successfully achieved in the output without unintended side effects? For example, “increase the reward outcome” counterfactual: modify latent such that the decoded sequence yields a higher reward at the end (imagine the agent took a better path). We can evaluate how often the generated trajectory actually has higher reward, and whether it remains plausible. This might require integrating the dynamics model (for multi-step counterfactuals): essentially doing planning in latent space toward a desired outcome (as Dreamer does for control). The difference is we’re evaluating the *quality of the imagined trajectories* rather than the policy’s performance. DreamerV2/V3 have shown that imagined trajectories in latent space can be used to plan actions that succeed in the real environment, which indirectly validates that those latent rollouts are meaningful and maintain realism.

**Experiments:** (a) *Latent substitution:* Identify a factor to change (e.g. “what if reward was higher?” which might correlate with being in the goal region). Take a trajectory where the agent did not reach goal and one where it did. Swap the high-level latent (goal-related context) between them at some point, decode the new trajectory, and see if it looks like the first agent somehow finding a goal. (b) *Action counterfactual:* Take a state latent $z_t$ and instead of following the actual next action $a_t$, push the latent through the dynamics model with an alternative action $a'_t$. Decode the imagined next observation. Compare this to either actual environment results (if we can simulate from that state) or at least validate basic rules (did the agent move in the intended alternate direction?). Essentially, we are querying the model: “if at this point you went left instead of right, what would you see?” This tests the model’s learned transition dynamics in a counterfactual manner. If the model is accurate, these counterfactual predictions should align with what the simulator would show for that alternate action. (c) *Latent algebra for concept insertion:* Compute latent differences that represent certain changes (like with/without certain object). One way to get this difference is to average latents of states with the object minus without the object. Add this difference to a latent lacking the object and decode, expecting the object to appear. Count the success rate by checking decoded images. This replicates experiments done in style transfer and GAN literature, but here for state representations (in a sense, “add obstacle” is like a style transfer in the environment). (d) *Multimodal counterfactuals:* If our VAE is multimodal (e.g. image + proprioception), we can try generating one modality conditionally. For example, “imagine the same trajectory but with different sensor readings” – perhaps irrelevant if sensors are tied to state, but if some internal variables can vary independently (like imagine same vision but if the agent were more tired – purely hypothetical), we could attempt to modify internal state latent while keeping visual latent. This might not apply strongly in gridworld, but in robotics, one could imagine “same camera input but different joint angles” to check if model can mix modalities coherently.

For **deliverables**, we will produce a *counterfactual generation toolkit*. This may be a set of Jupyter notebooks where a user can pick a scenario and apply preset latent operations (like “toggle door open/closed” or “insert obstacle”) and see the decoded result. We will accompany this with a **qualitative report** including examples of successful and failed counterfactuals. For instance, an image sequence: original scenario, the “what if” scenario generated by the model, and commentary on whether the model’s imagination is logical. We will also report any quantitative metrics from the automated checks (e.g., 90% of imagined states remained valid under the environment’s rules; in 85% of trials the intended attribute change was achieved). The ability to generate counterfactual experiences demonstrates that the embedding isn’t just rote encoding but has learned a *flexible generative model* of the environment’s dynamics, allowing us to explore hypothetical situations. This is closely tied to the concept of *imagination in model-based RL*, as seen in World Models and Dreamer (agents that “dream” trajectories to decide on optimal actions). Validating this aspect gives confidence that the agent’s internal model can be used not only to reconstruct what *has* happened, but also to reason about what *could* happen under different circumstances.

## 8. Generalization and Robustness

**Goal:** Verify that the learned embedding generalizes well to new scenarios and is robust to variations in input. This means the representation should work across diverse environments (or tasks) beyond the training distribution, and it should degrade gracefully if some sensory modalities are noisy, corrupted, or even missing. Essentially, we want a *versatile* latent space that isn’t narrowly overfitted to one environment.

**Methods:** **Cross-environment generalization:** Train the VAE (and world model) on a set of environments or tasks, then evaluate how the encoding performs on a new environment that the model hasn’t seen. For a 2D gridworld, this could mean altering the layout, or adding new objects, or changing visual appearance (different textures), and checking if the original encoder can still produce useful representations. “Useful” can mean two things: (1) reconstructions are still reasonable (even if imperfect, the latent captures the new environment enough to reconstruct it with some fidelity), and (2) downstream, if we use those latents for control or analysis, they still correlate with important state variables. We may not expect perfect performance without fine-tuning, but a robust representation should partially generalize. A recent trend in RL is using *pre-trained encoders* to improve generalization – e.g., **Yuan et al. (2022b)** showed that an image encoder pre-trained on broad data can be reused in novel tasks to improve generalizable RL. We can take inspiration by perhaps pre-training our model on multiple gridworlds and testing on a new one. The evaluation could involve retraining a small policy on top of the latent for the new task and seeing if it learns faster than from scratch (indicative that the latent provides transferable features). We might also compute representation similarity metrics like CKA (Centered Kernel Alignment) between latent spaces of training vs test environments to see if the geometry is preserved.

**Robustness under modality perturbations:** Because our model is multimodal, we should test scenarios where one modality is compromised. For example, **visual corruption**: feed images with occlusion or noise to the encoder and see if the latent still captures the essential state (the agent might rely on proprioceptive input to compensate). Or **missing modality**: what if the agent’s camera fails (no visual input)? A robust multi-modal VAE could fall back on internal state inputs and still produce a reasonable latent (perhaps by relying on learned prior for the missing view). Some VAE architectures explicitly handle missing data – e.g., Joint VAEs or mixture-of-expert VAEs can infer latent even if one modality is absent. In our context, we can simulate this by zeroing out or masking a modality at test time and then measuring how much the latent and reconstruction degrade. If the design is truly robust, the latent can still be inferred (with higher uncertainty) and the decoder can imagine the missing parts. For instance, **Guerrero-López et al. (2022)** emphasize their hierarchical multi-modal VAE’s ability to naturally handle missing views due to its factorized design. They achieve this by having separate encoders per view that all contribute to a shared global latent – thus, if one view is missing, the global latent can still be formed from the others. Our evaluation will mimic that: drop one modality and see if the remaining still predict the dropped one to some extent (i.e., the decoder tries to reconstruct even the missing modality’s data). The error when a modality is missing versus present is a measure of robustness.

**Experiments:** (a) *Multi-task generalization:* Train the agent’s embedding on GridWorld levels 1–3 and test on level 4. Quantitatively, we could run the same policy (if one is trained) on level 4 using the latent and see if it still performs reasonably (though not trained on that level). Alternatively, train a new lightweight model (like a linear classifier for a simple behavior) on the latent of the new level and compare performance or sample-efficiency against a baseline (like pixel input). If the latent is good, even in a new environment the high-level features it provides (e.g. agent’s relative position to goal, etc.) should still accelerate learning. (b) *Out-of-distribution state encoding:* Identify a state that was never encountered in training (like a configuration of objects that’s novel). Feed it through the encoder and then examine the latent and reconstruction. Does the reconstruction look reasonable (even if it might blur unknown details)? Does the latent fall in a sensible region (perhaps by checking if the dynamics model can handle it without divergence)? We expect some performance drop, but the key is that the representation shouldn’t break catastrophically – it might interpolate based on what it knows. (c) *Noise and occlusion tests:* Add Gaussian noise to input images or drop some sensor readings randomly. Measure the change in latent (e.g. how far $z_\text{noisy}$ deviates from $z_\text{clean}$ for the same state). A robust embedding would be relatively stable – small input perturbations yielding only small latent changes (this is related to adversarial robustness). We could quantify robustness as $R = \frac{|z(x) - z(\tilde{x})|}{|x - \tilde{x}|}$ for perturbations $\tilde{x}$. Lower $R$ means the latent is less sensitive to noise than the input is. (d) *Modality drop-out:* Zero out the image and feed only internal state and previous action into the encoder (assuming it was trained multimodally). Then use the decoder to reconstruct the image (essentially image imputation from state). We can’t expect miracles, but the decoder might produce a plausible guess (e.g. a generic looking room). Evaluate the reconstruction error in this scenario. If using approaches like Product-of-Experts for inference, the VAE can infer latent from partial inputs by relying on the prior and remaining modalities. The performance gap between full-input and partial-input reconstructions is an indicator of robustness to missing data. We should also test the reverse (drop internal state but keep image, etc.).

The deliverables will include a **generalization and robustness report** detailing these findings. For example, we might report that *the embedding trained on gridworlds with 2 rooms generalized to a 3-room gridworld with only a 10% increase in reconstruction error and allowed the agent to adapt with half the training time compared to pixel inputs*. We’ll include tables of reconstruction SSIM with various modalities ablated, and perhaps learning curves for transfer learning experiments. Additionally, any failure cases will be documented (e.g., if there’s a kind of environment change the latent could not handle, like a completely new object it has never seen – the model might reconstruct it as a blur or as something from its training set, a sign of *model bias*). We can make recommendations such as increasing latent size or using contrastive objectives if we observe poor generalization in some aspects. Fundamentally, demonstrating generalization underscores that the latent space is capturing *underlying structure* of the task (like geometry of the world, agent dynamics) rather than overfitting to superficial specifics of training scenarios. This aligns with findings from representation learning surveys: a representation that transfers to new settings is usually one that focuses on core factors of variation and is invariant to irrelevant changes.

## 9. Online and Incremental Updating Evaluation

**Goal:** Assess how well the embedding can be updated or fine-tuned in an *online setting*, i.e., as new data comes in from the agent’s ongoing experience. We want to ensure that incrementally updating the representation does not cause catastrophic forgetting or instability, and that the embedding can personalize or adapt to an individual agent if needed (e.g. different dynamics or sensors for another agent). This section effectively tests the *continual learning* aspect of the model.

**Methods:** **Online updating tests:** Simulate an online learning scenario where the agent is continuously collecting new data and we periodically update the VAE’s parameters (or a subset of them) with a small learning rate. We monitor metrics over time: does reconstruction error on past data start to increase (a sign of forgetting)? Does the latent space drift significantly (which could throw off a downstream policy)? There are known challenges here – naive online training can cause representational drift that confuses the policy. We may compare two strategies: (1) **Fixed encoder** – no online update, and (2) **Continual encoder update** – allow the encoder/decoder to learn with new data. The performance of the RL agent (if one is learning) or the stability of reconstructions can indicate which is better. Some recent works propose solutions like *feature replay, regularization (e.g. EWC), or separate learning rates* to stabilize online representation learning. In our case, we might include a small rehearsal buffer of past observations to mix into training so the autoencoder doesn’t forget earlier states. Quantitatively, we can measure the *embedding drift* by picking a set of reference observations and encoding them before and after incremental updates; then compute the distance moved in latent space. Ideally, important features don’t shift too much, or if they do, the downstream consumer of the latent (policy) is able to adapt in sync.

**Personalization layers:** One idea mentioned is agent-specific layers – for example, a small adaptor network on top of a shared embedding. We can evaluate the effectiveness of this by training such a layer for a new agent/environment while keeping the base encoder fixed. This is akin to *lightweight fine-tuning*. **Zhang et al. (2024a)** discuss “light-weight probing of unsupervised representations” in RL, which suggests that rather than retraining the whole representation, one can train a small probe (or a small adjustment) to adapt to new tasks. In our evaluation, we might measure performance (e.g. task success or reconstruction fidelity) when adapting via a small personalized layer vs. when fully fine-tuning the entire encoder. If the personalized layer approach yields nearly as good performance with less training and more stability, that’s a positive. Similarly, if multiple agents (with slightly different sensor characteristics) each learn a tiny adapter on top of a common latent space, we’d like to see that they can all achieve good reconstructions/policies without diverging the main latent space for each.

Concretely, we could have Agent A and Agent B (maybe different dynamics or slightly different field-of-view). Train the VAE on Agent A. Then for Agent B, *freeze* most of the VAE and only learn a small shift or scaling of the latent (or a small recalibration network) to handle the differences. Evaluate B’s reconstruction error or policy performance compared to if we fine-tuned the whole VAE to B. If the difference is small, it means the core latent space was general enough and just needed minor tweaking – evidence of a robust, adaptable representation.

**Experiments:** (a) *Incremental data experiment:* Start with a trained model on some initial dataset. Then feed new data sequentially (perhaps the agent moves into previously unseen states gradually). Update the VAE continually. Keep track of a *held-out test set from the initial data*. Monitor its reconstruction error over time. If that error grows, the model is forgetting earlier states as it tunes to new ones – undesirable. We may apply regularization to see if we can prevent that. Also monitor the reconstruction on the new data – it should improve as expected. We might find that a strategy like **fine-tuning only certain layers** (e.g. only the last decoder layer for new visual details) yields less forgetting than tuning everything. So we could try different incremental update schemes and compare their stability. (b) *Policy performance drift:* If we have a policy learning in parallel (e.g. using the latent as state for RL), track its reward over time under the two conditions: static vs continually learned latent. Prior research (e.g. in **SLAC or Dreamer**) often keeps the representation learning going while RL runs, but there’s a delicate balance. We can measure if the policy’s performance dips or variance spikes when the representation is being updated (which might indicate representational drift causing relearning). If we see smoother learning with a fixed rep vs oscillations with a changing rep, that highlights an issue. (c) *New task adaptation:* After initial training, present a new task or changed environment and allow the representation to update. See how quickly it adapts (e.g., how many new samples to adequately reconstruct new observations) and whether it retains performance on the original task. For example, train on a gridworld, then suddenly change the reward structure or add traps – see if the latent can incorporate this (maybe by encoding a new “trap” feature) without losing the original features. Perhaps we measure success in the new task (with minimal additional training) as a function of whether we updated the latent or not. (d) *Agent-specific adaptation:* Train representation on one agent’s data. Then for a second agent (maybe the same environment but the agent has a different size or speed), do one of: full fine-tune vs. adapter-layer. Evaluate how well each approach works in terms of reconstruction and any policy if applicable. If the adapter method achieves, say, 95% of the performance with only 10% of parameters adjusted, it’s a win for modularity. We’ll use metrics like final reconstruction error for agent B and time taken to converge.

Deliverables will include an **online learning evaluation module**, possibly implemented as a simulation that runs the agent and updates the model in tandem, logging metrics. We will provide plots showing things like “Reconstruction error on old vs new data over time” and “Policy reward over episodes for static vs dynamic representation”. Additionally, a short report will summarize whether incremental updates were beneficial or if they introduced instability. We will likely refer to known solutions from literature if we encounter problems – e.g., if catastrophic forgetting is observed, note that techniques like experience replay or constraint-based regularization (as used in continual learning research) could mitigate it. The overall aim is to demonstrate that our embedding can *grow and adapt* with the agent’s experience. In a long-lived agent, it’s crucial that the representation keeps improving without wiping out previously learned features. By showing, for instance, that adding a personalization layer for a new context quickly recovers performance, we provide evidence that the embedding framework is amenable to lifelong learning and multi-agent deployments.

## 10. Visualization and Interpretability

**Goal:** Provide tools to *understand* and *interpret* the learned embedding. It’s important to be able to peek into the latent space to build trust and gain insights (especially for debugging or explaining agent behavior). This involves visualizing latent structures, interactions, and possibly how input features map to latent features (and vice versa).

**Methods:** **Interactive visualizations:** Develop an interactive dashboard that allows exploration of the latent space. For example, a 2D projection (via UMAP) of many latent points where one can select a point or cluster and see the corresponding original state or reconstruction. We could incorporate sliders to manipulate a chosen latent code and see the decoded output change in real time (this is essentially latent traversal at the user’s control). Such tools have been extremely useful in the generative model community – e.g., the *World Models* interactive article provided sliders for each latent dimension to see how game images changed. Providing this to stakeholders (designers, researchers) can help them identify, say, “latent dimension 7 seems to control agent’s heading” by observing the decoder’s output while moving that slider. We will also visualize **temporal trajectories** in latent space: for instance, plot the latent code over time (in a lower-dimensional PCA space) to see the agent’s path through latent state space. Patterns here could show cycles (if the agent repeats behaviors) or distinct phases of an episode appearing as separate regions. Visualizing attention is another aspect if our model uses an attention mechanism (some hierarchical VAEs or transformers do). We could overlay attention heatmaps on input images to show which parts the encoder is focusing on for a given latent – aiding interpretability of *why* the representation encodes what it does.

**Latent queries and introspection:** We might implement a way to query the latent space: e.g., “find all latent states similar to this one” (basically nearest neighbor lookup) or “find latent states where the agent is in the top-right corner” (if we have a way to query by property, perhaps via a learned predictor or tags). This turns the embedding into a sort of *database* that can be queried for insights. For example, if the agent exhibits a weird behavior, one could pick that state’s latent and query for similar latents to find other instances of that behavior. If the model has learned meaningful clusters, this will surface relevant results (this is similar to content-based retrieval using learned embeddings, common in computer vision databases).

Another useful visualization is **embedding-space arithmetic results** (similar to Section 7’s experiments): show side-by-side the outcome of latent vector operations (like “latent of scenario X plus latent of scenario Y minus latent of scenario Z”) to see if interpretability emerges (e.g., combining aspects of two scenarios). If the operations yield sensible results, that’s a strong indication that latent dimensions have interpretable linear structure.

We will also produce **documentation of what each latent dimension or group seems to correspond to** (if discernible). This can be done by analyzing the decoder weights or using the traversal method mentioned. For example, after some manual or automated exploration, we might list: *$z_1$ – agent’s x-position, $z_2$ – agent’s y-position, $z_3$ – presence of enemy, ...* (this is hypothetical, but even partial interpretability like this is valuable). In the *SRL Toolbox* (Lesort et al., 2018), the authors included visualization tools precisely to inspect such correspondences and aid in interpreting the learned state representation.

**Experiments:** (a) *UMAP/t-SNE plot by labels:* We’ll create a scatter plot of latent vectors from many episodes, coloring points by various labels: episode reward achieved, whether the agent was in danger, etc. Present these to see if the latent space separation aligns with these labels (and to allow a human to spot patterns). (b) *Trajectory 3D animation:* Represent an episode’s latent states as a connected line in a 3D PCA space; possibly animate the agent’s observation alongside as it moves through latent space. This helps us see how the model views state transitions. For example, the trajectory might stay in one tight region for a while (maybe when the agent is circling in one room) then jump to another region when it goes through a door – giving a visual cue that the latent recognized a context switch. (c) *Attention heatmaps:* If our encoder is something like a vision transformer or has attention, pick a frame and visualize where the model is “looking.” Does it attend to the goal location, to moving objects? If yes, that hints the representation focuses on relevant features (which is desirable for interpretability and performance). If it attends to something irrelevant (like a corner with no significance), that might indicate some bias. Attention maps have been used to interpret agents (e.g., in **interpretable RL** research, see *Mott et al. 2019* for an attention agent whose focus could be visualized). (d) *Component analysis:* Use PCA or ICA on the latent vectors to see if any single component aligns with an intuitive factor. If, say, PC1 correlates 90% with the agent’s health, then we can report that. (e) *User testing:* If possible, let a user manipulate latent sliders in a sandbox environment to test if they can understand and control certain aspects. This is less formal but could yield anecdotes like “By adjusting this knob, I can reliably make the agent drop the key – so that latent clearly encodes key possession.”

The outcome will be a **visualization toolkit and dashboard** that can be used during presentations or analysis. We will include snapshots of these visualizations in our final report, showing, for instance, a 2D latent space plot with clusters annotated, or a sequence of decoded images as a latent is varied (demonstrating an interpretable change). The interpretability report will summarize what we learned about the latent representation – e.g., “latent dimension 5 and 6 correspond to spatial coordinates in the maze, as evidenced by linear correlation with true (x,y) and by decoding images with those dimensions varied.” It might also highlight if some dimensions or subspaces appear entangled or hard to interpret, guiding future improvements. The goal here is not just to have a black-box representation, but to shine some light on it. This aligns with the broader trend in AI towards explainability: having a powerful latent model is great, but being able to *explain* its components (even if only partially) builds confidence. We know from the world model work that one can gain intuition by visualizing the agent’s “dreams” and latent organization. By providing these tools, we ensure that our embedding isn’t an inscrutable vector – we can poke at it and see understandable results.

## 11. Downstream Utility Validation

**Goal:** Finally, validate that the learned embeddings are not just theoretically good, but *practically useful* for real tasks that the agent needs to perform – such as planning, decision making, or introspective reasoning about its experiences. Essentially, we demonstrate the value of the representation by showing it improves performance or capabilities on downstream tasks compared to baseline approaches.

**Methods:** **Task-specific benchmarks:** We will integrate the embedding into one or more downstream tasks and measure the impact. A primary example is **planning/control**: use the latent dynamics model for decision making (e.g., planning trajectories to maximize reward). This is exactly what model-based RL algorithms like *PlaNet* and *Dreamer* do – they report how well an agent can perform using the learned model. We should compare our agent’s performance (with the learned world model) to a baseline (like a model-free agent or an agent using raw observations). If our embedding is effective, the agent should reach higher reward with fewer samples (because the representation focuses on the right stuff). Hafner et al. (2019) showed their latent dynamics agent (PlaNet) could solve continuous control tasks with far fewer episodes than model-free methods, thanks in part to a good latent representation. We’d expect similar benefits in our domain. We can also test **introspection tasks**: for instance, *counterfactual planning* – ask the agent’s model to find a latent sequence that achieves a certain goal state, then see if that can be enacted. Since we already evaluate counterfactual generation (section 7), here we focus on utility: does having that ability let the agent make better decisions? We could set up a situation where the agent considers “what if I go left vs right” by simulating in latent space, and verify if it indeed chooses the option that yields a better outcome, matching what an actual trial would have shown. This validates that the latent dynamics are accurate enough for foresight.

Another downstream use is **narrative or explanation generation**: Since the latent is a compressed record of the agent’s experience, perhaps we can train a simple model to translate a latent trajectory into a natural language description or a summary (“The agent went through the green door, picked up the key, then opened the treasure box.”). This would show that the latent encodes high-level events that a language model can pick up on. It might be ambitious, but even a structured summary (like a sequence of high-level state labels) derived from the latent would demonstrate interpretability and usefulness for communication. In research, there is work on *trajectory summaries* and using embeddings for memory (e.g., episode memory in meta-learning). If time permits, we could attempt a small case: e.g., cluster the latent trajectory into segments and label them (“exploring”, “combat”, “goal reached”). If the clustering correlates with meaningful phases, that’s a utility in itself (automatically segmenting an episode into meaningful parts).

**Embedding utility case studies:** We should prepare at least one illustrative case where using the embedding solves a problem that is hard to solve otherwise. For instance, consider a *transfer learning scenario*: train an agent on one task, then give it a new task that shares structure. Using the learned latent as input, does it learn the new task faster? That would highlight the embedding’s general utility. Or a *multi-task policy*: train one policy that takes the latent and a task identifier to solve multiple tasks. If the latent nicely encodes state in a task-agnostic way, a single policy head can succeed at several tasks (this was done in some multitask RL works where a shared representation is learned and a small network is tuned per task). We can measure success rates or rewards on those tasks.

We can also examine if the embedding helps in *analysing agent failures*. E.g., if the agent fails an episode, check its latent trajectory – perhaps it got stuck in a certain cluster (meaning a kind of situation). Recognizing that cluster might tell us “the agent was confused by a distractor” which is why it failed. This is more anecdotal but can be powerful to demonstrate introspection: that you can look at the latent and diagnose issues in agent behavior. Some recent works have used representation distances to detect novelty or anomalies – e.g., if a state’s latent is far from the training distribution, the agent might be in a novel situation and one could flag that. This is another downstream utility: *uncertainty estimation*. Our model’s likelihood (or reconstruction error) can serve as an anomaly detector for out-of-distribution states, which is useful for safety.

**Experiments:** (a) *Policy learning benchmark:* Train a RL agent that uses the learned latent (with the dynamics model for planning, or even model-free using latent as input) on a set of tasks. Compare learning curves to an agent that uses raw pixels or some other representation. Metrics: cumulative reward, convergence speed. We expect improvements especially in sample efficiency. If possible, do this on multiple tasks (like variations of Gridworld) to show broad utility. For example, world models like Dreamer report state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks using their learned latent, so we can similarly report that our agent “solved X rooms puzzle in so-and-so steps, whereas a baseline took much longer.” (b) *Zero-shot or few-shot transfer:* Take the embedding from one task, use it in a new task without retraining (or with minimal fine-tuning as per section 9) and see if the agent can perform (maybe with a quick adaptation of the policy network). If it succeeds, that’s a strong evidence of a *general representation*. (c) *Querying memory:* Use the latent to answer questions like “Have you seen this situation before?” or “What was the outcome last time you were here?”. Concretely, maintain an archive of latent states with associated outcomes, and when the agent is in a new state, find the nearest archive latent and retrieve the outcome. If it matches, the agent can use that as a clue (like episodic memory). Test if this improves performance or decision making. This would validate introspective use of the embedding for memory-based planning – similar in spirit to *episodic control* methods but using our learned latent as keys. (d) *Human-readability test:* Try to generate a simple human-understandable description from a latent sequence. We might train a classifier on latent to predict a set of high-level event labels (like “opened door”, “got reward”). Evaluate its accuracy vs ground truth event annotations. If high, it means the latent cleanly encodes those events in a way a simple model can extract.

**Deliverables:** We will produce *downstream task benchmarks* results, likely in the form of plots and tables. For example, a table comparing success rates of agents with different representations on tasks (embedding vs raw vs perhaps hand-engineered features). Also, any qualitative case studies – e.g., showing a trajectory where planning with the latent clearly outperforms a baseline, or showing a transferred policy working immediately on a new level. The final report will highlight that *the latent representation is not just an academic exercise but provides concrete benefits*: improved learning efficiency, the ability to do imagination-based planning (leading to better decisions), and easier introspection. We might cite results like DreamerV3 (2023) which showed a single latent world model can achieve high performance across 150 tasks – reinforcing that a well-validated representation can be a general backbone for intelligence. By drawing parallels to such state-of-the-art systems, we argue that our rigorous evaluation (covering reconstruction, traversability, etc.) has yielded a robust latent space that enables the agent to plan and reason effectively in its world.

---

## Final Outputs and Contributions

Through the systematic implementation of the above evaluation components, we expect to deliver:

- **A comprehensive embedding evaluation framework** that researchers can use for similar representation learning projects. This includes standardized metrics, procedures, and visualization tools covering reconstruction fidelity, latent space continuity, clustering quality, semantic consistency, temporal dynamics, hierarchical abstraction, and downstream utility. Essentially, we are packaging the evaluation methodology as a toolkit (with code and documentation) so that any multimodal VAE or world model can be put through its paces in a similar manner. Prior efforts like the S-RL (State Representation Learning) Toolbox attempted to unify such evaluations; our work updates and expands this to the multimodal, hierarchical setting, incorporating recent metrics (e.g., those from 2021–2024 literature on continuity and probing).
- **Validated metrics and findings**: We will provide baseline numbers for all the metrics (reconstruction error rates, silhouette scores, prediction accuracies, etc.) for our model, and possibly for ablations (like non-hierarchical version, or single-modal version for comparison). These benchmarks can serve as a reference for future improvements. For example, we might report “image recon MSE = X, latent traversal semantic score = Y, silhouette score = Z, etc.” along with interpretation. If some metrics reveal weaknesses (e.g., poor clustering purity with respect to a certain semantic), we identify those as areas for model improvement (like needing a stronger disentanglement objective).
- **Visualization suite**: We will deliver an interactive or at least user-friendly set of visualizations (possibly as a web dashboard or a series of plots in the report) that demonstrate key aspects of the embedding. This includes original vs reconstructed images, latent interpolation videos, t-SNE plots with annotations, and example latent manipulations with decoded outputs. These visuals are not only useful for analysis but also for communication – for instance, showing a before-and-after of a counterfactual scenario or a figure of the hierarchical latent structure in action can greatly help others grasp what the representation is doing.
- **Interpretability analysis**: A section of the report will be devoted to describing in plain language what the different parts of the latent representation correspond to (as far as we can tell). We might say, for instance, “We found that one of the top-level latent dimensions corresponds to the presence of an enemy, and another to the room ID – evidence: when we vary these dimensions, the decoded frames toggle the enemy and change room appearance, respectively.” Such insights make the black-box model more transparent. Even if not every latent factor is interpretable, highlighting the ones that are is valuable.
- **Downstream examples and case studies**: We will document at least one concrete example of using the embedding in a practical scenario: e.g., *Agent planning with imagination:* show how the agent simulates two outcomes in latent space and chooses the better, leading to success (with a figure illustrating the imagined trajectories and actual outcome). Another example: *Transfer to a new environment:* describing how the representation helped quickly solve a new task (citing the performance numbers). These examples ground our evaluation in actual agent behavior and demonstrate the **practical value** of the representation beyond just nice properties in isolation.

In summary, by rigorously validating each aspect – from low-level reconstruction to high-level decision making – we ensure our multimodal, hierarchical VAE yields **robust, interpretable, and useful** latent representations for the artificial agent. This end-to-end evaluation gives us confidence that the agent’s “understanding” of its world (as captured in the embedding) is accurate (fidelity), smooth and well-organized (traversable, clustered), stable to small changes (consistent), temporally coherent (respects dynamics), structured by abstraction level (hierarchical), creatively generative (imaginative), generalizes across scenarios (robust), adapts over time (incremental learning), is explainable to humans (visualizations), and ultimately *helps the agent perform better* on its tasks (utility). These contributions put together represent a comprehensive pipeline for latent representation validation, pushing beyond prior work by combining many evaluation dimensions that were previously considered in isolation. We believe this thorough approach will set a high standard for evaluating world-model style agents and will be a useful reference for the community in developing and testing future representations for intelligent agents.

**Sources:** The methodology and importance of each evaluation aspect are drawn from a broad range of foundational and recent works in representation learning and model-based RL, including surveys of state representation learning, world model research, disentangled VAE studies, and robust multi-modal learning frameworks, as discussed throughout this report. Each facet of our plan is grounded in techniques validated by prior studies – for instance, using SSIM for reconstruction quality, verifying latent continuity for policy stability, clustering analysis for semantic grouping, enforcing temporal coherence in learned states, assessing hierarchy via factor isolation, generating counterfactuals via latent manipulation, testing generalization with pre-trained encoders, evaluating online adaptation via lightweight probes, visualizing embeddings for interpretability, and demonstrating improved downstream performance akin to Dreamer’s achievements. By integrating these ideas, our evaluation plan ensures a rigorous and holistic validation of the agent’s embedding space, bridging the gap between theoretical representation quality and practical agent performance.
