# **Hierarchical Abstraction in Latent Embedding Systems**

## **1. Exploration of Abstraction Levels**

### Goals:

- Clearly identify and differentiate abstraction levels:
    - **Low-level**: sensorimotor observations, short-step transitions.
    - **Mid-level**: episodic events, phase-like behaviors.
    - **High-level**: conceptual strategies, goals, or persistent traits.

### Methods:

- Qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis:
    - Visualize modality-level data at multiple temporal granularities.
    - Learn **event boundaries** using prediction-based segmentation (e.g., boundary-sensitive RNNs).
    - Identify natural groupings and abstraction candidates.

### Experiments:

- Analyze variance at each abstraction level (timestep → episode → concept).
- Clustering and PCA/UMAP across scales.
- Event segmentation accuracy and boundary detection precision.

### Deliverables:

- Abstraction hierarchy report with representative examples.
- Event segmentation module.
- Visualization toolkit for comparing abstraction layers.

## **2. Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAE)**

### Goals:

- Explicitly model hierarchical latent structures with increasing abstraction.

### Methods:

- Implement HVAE architectures with layered encoders/decoders:
    - Sensorimotor (bottom), episodic (middle), conceptual (top).
- Train with joint loss:
    - Multi-level reconstruction + KL divergence at each latent tier.
- Use **staged or joint training** to control learning dynamics.

### Experiments:

- Ablation studies on depth, capacity, and layer interaction.
- Cross-layer disentanglement and reconstruction tests.

### Deliverables:

- Tuned HVAE model.
- Layer-wise interpretability and reconstruction fidelity metrics.

## **3. Attention-Based Temporal Pooling**

### Goals:

- Dynamically extract and summarize important temporal segments.

### Methods:

- Apply temporal attention pooling:
    - Weight fine-grained embeddings to produce episodic/conceptual summaries.
    - Leverage **event-attention** to enhance change-point detection.

### Experiments:

- Visualize attention scores over time.
- Compare fixed vs. attention-based pooling for semantic coverage.
- Correlate attention peaks with event boundaries.

### Deliverables:

- Attention-pooling module and visualizations.
- Segment-level abstraction visual dashboard.

## **4. Self-Supervised Auxiliary Tasks**

### Goals:

- Shape semantic structure via auxiliary supervision.

### Methods:

- Train on auxiliary prediction tasks:
    - **Phase prediction**: Classify episode segments.
    - **Reward forecasting**: Predict future rewards and reward presence.
    - **Conceptual event prediction**: Predict occurrence/types of abstract events.
- Use **semantic prompting** where applicable.

### Experiments:

- Latent clustering purity vs. auxiliary task labels.
- Phase transition prediction and reward alignment.
- Embedding drift across auxiliary objectives.

### Deliverables:

- Self-supervised task suite.
- Latent evolution analysis with/without tasks.

## **5. Abstraction Consistency & Interpretability**

### Goals:

- Maintain consistent and interpretable abstractions across runs and agents.

### Methods:

- **Contrastive learning** with InfoNCE or MoCo:
    - Pull together embeddings from similar events, push apart distinct ones.
- Perform **cluster purity** evaluation and human labeling checks.
- Include **behavioral examples** for each cluster.

### Experiments:

- Semantic cluster metrics (purity, NMI).
- Human-in-the-loop evaluation for naming and explanation of clusters.

### Deliverables:

- Contrastive abstraction model.
- Cluster meaning audit and visual summaries.

---

## **6. Cross-Level Consistency & Traversability**

### Goals:

- Ensure semantic coherence across abstraction layers.

### Methods:

- Support **drill-down** (conceptual → episodic → timestep) and **roll-up** traversals.
- Interpolate across latent levels to test smoothness.

### Experiments:

- Latent traversal paths: conceptual interpolation → decoded episodes.
- Consistency scoring across levels (e.g., policy coherence, goal retention).

### Deliverables:

- Latent traversal and drill-down explorer.
- Consistency reports across transitions and levels.

---

## **7. Generalization and Transferability**

### Goals:

- Validate hierarchical abstractions across new tasks or domains.

### Methods:

- Train in environment A, evaluate in environment B.
- Evaluate whether higher-level abstractions remain stable and useful.

### Experiments:

- Zero-shot transfer and few-shot learning with fixed latent hierarchies.
- Robustness to noise or distractor modalities.

### Deliverables:

- Transfer experiments and generalization metrics.
- Scenario comparison report.

---

## **8. Meta-Embedding (Self-Signature)**

### Goals:

- Create persistent behavior/identity embeddings.

### Methods:

- Generate meta-embeddings from episodic/conceptual latents over time.
- Evaluate stability and distinctiveness across agents/episodes.

### Experiments:

- Clustering of embeddings by agent or strategy.
- Conditioning a policy or decoder on meta-embedding and testing generalization.
- Visualization of behavioral drift in meta-space.

### Deliverables:

- Meta-embedding module.
- Behavior signature evaluation report.

## **9. Multimodal and Temporal Fusion**

### Goals:

- Integrate hierarchical abstractions with multimodal-temporal structure.

### Methods:

- Design **joint attention or cross-modal fusion** at multiple abstraction levels.
- Evaluate semantic retention from each modality.

### Experiments:

- Cross-modal coherence and missing modality robustness.
- Performance of combined vs. unimodal embeddings on downstream tasks.

### Deliverables:

- Integrated hierarchical-multimodal embedding system.
- Modality contribution visualizations.

## **10. Interactive Visualization & Introspection**

### Goals:

- Provide tools for exploring, debugging, and interpreting embeddings.

### Methods:

- Build interactive dashboards:
    - UMAP/t-SNE projections by layer.
    - Click-through drill-downs from abstract to detailed episodes.
    - Overlay reward, task phase, or agent metadata.

### Deliverables:

- **Cross-modal consistency**.
