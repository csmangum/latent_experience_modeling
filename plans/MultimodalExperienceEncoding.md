    - Reward signals: distribution, frequency, correlation with other modalities.
- Identify redundancy, complementarity, and potential semantic overlaps.

## üîç Core Takeaways from Each Phase of the Plan

### **1. Modality Characterization**

**Takeaway:**

> Don‚Äôt skip or rush EDA. The insights you gain here will directly affect your fusion strategy, weighting mechanisms, and dropout ablations. You are laying the groundwork for interpretability and compression trade-offs.
> 
- Prioritize: correlations, redundancy, and variance across time.
- Consider: dimensionality normalization before fusion.

---

### **2. Baseline Fusion Approaches**

**Takeaway:**

> Establish baselines early. They serve as sanity checks and help you identify whether later complexity (e.g. attention) is adding structure or just overfitting.
> 
- Evaluate: semantic coherence, not just reconstruction loss.
- Track: modality dominance or vanishing in joint embeddings.

---

### **3. Cross-Modality Attention**

**Takeaway:**

> Attention isn‚Äôt just for performance‚Äîit‚Äôs your interpretability tool. Tune it not just for accuracy, but for clarity: can you see where information flows?
> 
- Visualize attention weights by modality and timestep.
- Use bottleneck tokens to control cross-modal information flow.

---

### **4. Reward and Affect Embedding**

**Takeaway:**

> Affect-space modeling is one of your novel features. Lean into that. Build interpretable embeddings around valence, not just scalar reward prediction.
> 
- Use: contrastive learning to separate affective dimensions.
- Visualize: clusters and transitions between affect states.

---

### **5. Temporal Structure**

**Takeaway:**

> Your success depends on temporal coherence in the latent space. This supports counterfactual imagination and retrospective reasoning.
> 
- Implement: trajectory interpolation tests early.
- Use: skip connections or recurrence to reinforce long-term dynamics.

---

### **6. Hierarchical Abstractions**

**Takeaway:**

> This is where you'll model ‚Äúmeaningful events.‚Äù Focus on interpretability more than hierarchy depth.
> 
- Use: phase detection or reward shifts as abstraction triggers.
- Train: concept summarizers via auxiliary tasks (e.g., phase classification, return prediction).

---

### **7. Evaluation and Validation**

**Takeaway:**

> Most papers fail here. Your evaluation must reflect your philosophy: meaning, similarity, introspection‚Äînot just NLL.
> 
- Include: semantic retrieval tasks (find similar experience).
- Include: perturbation studies (measure semantic robustness).
- Consider: simple human-in-the-loop checks for plausibility.

---

### **8. Counterfactual Generation**

**Takeaway:**

> This is where introspection becomes agentive. You‚Äôll need a mechanism for latent manipulation‚Äîideally interpretable.
> 
- Prototype: latent arithmetic ("make this more rewarding").
- Evaluate: realism + plausibility of generated counterfactuals.

---

### **9. Scalability & Generalization**

**Takeaway:**

> Test early on diverse input distributions. Generalization will fall apart unless your latent space is structured and sparse.
> 
- Use: modular encoders and bottlenecks to avoid overfitting.
- Track: performance under online adaptation or environment change.

---

### **10. Interpretability & Visualization**

**Takeaway:**

> This is how you will explain, debug, and justify the system. Build the dashboard early.
> 
- Include: UMAP/t-SNE with semantic overlays.
- Visualize: attention, abstraction layers, latent drift.
- Prototype: an interactive interface for latent traversal and reconstruction.

---

### **Integration**

**Takeaway:**

> Keep your API clean and callable. You‚Äôre building a system meant to inform reasoning, not just compress experience.
> 
- Expose: `encode()`, `query()`, `counterfactual()`, `reconstruct()` endpoints.
- Plan for: downstream agents or planners to call your embedding functions.
