Call for Research Proposals
Application are reviewed on a rolling basis
CIMC is inviting research proposals, with the aim of understanding the nature and functionality of consciousness from a computationalist perspective. We want to conduct experimental philosophy by formulating testable theories, conducting simulations, and building artifacts that allow us to explore and test our understanding of consciousness.

Our approach is rooted in a rational, scientific epistemology, recognizing that current paradigms in philosophy of mind, neuroscience, and psychology fall short of comprehensively addressing mind and consciousness. We believe it is essential to develop new frameworks for understanding self, agency, intersubjectivity, and intelligence from first principles.

We welcome contributions from those ready to move beyond mere hypothesis formation. If you are an observer, modeler, engineer, interdisciplinary thinker, or artist eager to conceive, build, iterate, and test innovative ideas, we want to hear from you.

Research Focus Areas
We invite innovative research proposals in – but not limited to – the following broad categories. Proposals that venture outside the beaten path are welcome, provided they are of high quality and deeply considered.

1. Philosophical foundations and formalization of consciousness
Investigate the space and metaphysics of analytical theories of consciousness
What is consciousness, and how does it relate to mind, modeling, and reality?
How can we characterize phenomenology, functionality, and implementation?
Which systems can be conscious, and what are the necessary and sufficient conditions?
How can we test for consciousness?
2. Methodology of modeling consciousness
Can we define the "strange loop" analytically and test this formalization?
Should we search for consciousness by constructing and analyzing simulation spaces?
Can studying biological systems reveal the nature of consciousness?
3. Emergence and Role of Self in Learning Agents
Under what conditions does a learning agent form a first-person perspective or self-model?
How can we test for self-models?
What is a minimal self?
Development and study of models that integrate mind, self-model, motivation, and world-model interaction
4. Learning Through Self Organization
If consciousness is discovered by the brain (as part of a learning paradigm in a self organizing substrate), can we replicate this process artificially?
Can self organizing learning systems control agents?
Can we get a self organizing system (eg. NCA) to learn complex sequence prediction tasks?
Do we observe the discovery of self-improving self-reflexive structure? What are the limitations of this paradigm?
How can we understand the brain as a multiway system?
Can we discover implications for consciousness in comparable systems in nature (ie. how much does consciousness depend on the specific architecture of a learning system?)
5. Architectures for Conscious Agents
What is the role of attention and attention control in shaping conscious behavior?
How do perception, emotion, inference, and decision making interact in the development of conscious behavior?
How can we model aspects of human and animal psychology within artificial systems?
6. Developmental Learning Architectures
Can we design minimal, self-improving models that continuously learn and adapt (anytime learning)?
Artificial pets as paradigms for experimentation and interaction
Social simulations
7. Environments for Intelligent Behavior and Interaction Between Humans and AI
Under which conditions do intelligence and agency emerge?
What is the role of embodiment for the formation of a mind?
How can we create artificial environments that effectively evaluate AI behavior and facilitate human–AI interaction?
8. Consciousness and Selfhood in Current Foundation Models
Do existing foundation models possess phenomenology?
Can the self of simulated interaction agents be compared to a personal self?
Can interpretability help us understand the bounds and constraints of the possibilities of all possible simulacra or of individual simulacra?
Is CoT a paradigm that can be compared to consciousness?
How does adding and removing certain modalities influence the appearance of consciousness?
9. Extracting Models of Human Psychology from Foundation Models
Use of foundation models to create virtual test subjects
Development of psychometric tools to evaluate the personas of these models
Comparing human and artificial psychology
10. Transfer Between Artificial Intelligence Research, Neuroscience, and Psychology
What can AI research teach us about understanding biological intelligence?

11. Interaction Between Model Constraints and Substrate Constraints
How much does a model's behavior depend on the underlying substrate and its architecture?

12. Empathetic AI
High fidelity human machine interfaces
Modeling of user intentions
Feedback between human and AI systems
Human augmentation
Machine perception
Mechanisms for human machine extension
13. Ethics at the interface of human and non-human agents
Ethics is one of the most important topics in the context of artificial phenomenology, non-human agency, superhuman capability and coordination between individual, society, nature and artificial agents. It is also one of the most difficult, given the counter-intuitive nature of the subject; we invite contributions but will set a high bar.

14. Futurism
What developments should we expect, and how will they influence human society and identity?
Submission Guidelines
We welcome proposals that clearly articulate the research question, methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. Proposals should demonstrate understanding and alignment with CIMC's epistemology and be geared toward actionable research—whether theoretical, experimental, or applied.
